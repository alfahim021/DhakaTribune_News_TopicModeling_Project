World No 1 Sinner fought back from a set down in front of a packed crowd to continue his march towards a first title at Foro Italico. After a strangely slow start, Sinner again showed good form on centre court where, since returning to action last week from a three-month doping ban, he has taken his unbeaten run to 26 matches. And the 23-year old will face down Alcaraz, the last man to beat Sinner in the final at the China Open in early October, with all eyes on another potential final between the pair at the French Open next month. A win for Sinner against his rival would see the men's Rome title go to an Italian for the first time since Adriano Panatta in 1976. ""If I want to win Sunday I have to play one of my best tennis for sure,"" said Sinner. ""Carlos has played incredible tennis, so let's see what's coming but from my side you know incredible to be here in the final."" Alcaraz booked his place in the showdown by beating Sinner's countryman Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6 (7/4). The four-time Grand Slam champion overcame Musetti and the windy conditions in just over two hours to reach his fourth final of the season. ""I'm going to have dinner, but my phone is going to be there watching (Sinner's) match,"" said Alcaraz after his win. ""I have to know against who I'm going to play. I have to watch the match and see how they are going to play."" Musetti was beaten by Alcaraz in the Monte Carlo final last month and fell to his fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard after a frustrating display. And he believes that Alcaraz will have the better of it against Sinner if he brings his top form Sunday evening. ""I really rate Carlos. I think on clay that the best version of Carlos is favourite against anyone...that includes Jannik,"" he told reporters. Paul rattled off the first five games in 21 minutes in a near replica of what Sinner did to Casper Ruud Thursday, closing out the first set in less than half an hour. The last time Sinner lost a set 6-1 was in the quarter-finals of the US Open against Daniil Medvedev, a match he won on his way to his second Grand Slam triumph. Sinner looked a shadow of the player who dominated tennis throughout 2024 right up to the start of his suspension, which was agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency in early February. But from nowhere he came roaring back in the second set, finally forcing Paul back with some deep baseline shots of his own and his first aces of the match to win the second set to love and level the match. It was a complete role reversal with Paul now the one being thrown around the court, the world No 12 winning just 12 points in the second set and looking bewildered at how quickly the momentum shifted. Paul then handed Sinner the initiative with his second double fault of the night in game two of the third set. The Italian eventually won nine games in a row and marched on to victory. Earlier, Jasmine Paolini continued her bid to win the women's singles and doubles titles in Rome after reaching her second final of the week, this time alongside fellow Italian Sara Errani. Paolini and Errani, the reigning doubles champions, will meet Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in the final Sunday, before which Paolini could already be crowed singles champion. Late bloomer Paolini takes on Coco Gauff Saturday aiming for her second 1000 series title at the age of 29 and to become the first Italian women to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.",sports

Unai Emery's side had no margin for error at Villa Park as the race for top five places approaches a dramatic conclusion. Second-half goals from Ezri Konsa and Boubacar Kamara ensured Villa's battle to play in Europe's elite club competition will go down to the last day of the season. Fourth-placed Chelsea's 1-0 victory over Manchester United Friday means Villa still need sixth-placed Manchester City - one point behind Emery's men - to lose against Bournemouth in their game in hand Tuesday to be in control of their own destiny. Villa have won five of the last six games and one more victory at United on May 25 - plus a City loss in one of the remaining two matches - would seal their target of finishing in the top five. ""We won and we are on a run but still have work to do. We have to ready. We have a chance to play in the Champions League,"" Emery said. ""We were consistent, demanding and when we scored the first goal, they gave up. We needed to manage the 90 minutes and we worked it well.Â  ""We are in a good moment. We are being demanding. We can get Champions League - fantastic."" Tottenham were far more concerned with their own route into the Champions League - winning the Europa League final against United in Bilbao Wednesday. Languishing in 17th place after their 21st league defeat this term, Ange Postecoglou's troubled team are set for the worst finish since being relegated from the top-flight in 1976-77. Tottenham are without a win in their last six league matches, losing five times in that dismal streak. Already without injured trio Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison, Lucas Bergvall for the final, Postecoglou rested a host of key players including Dominic Solanke, Cristian Romero and Rodrigo Bentancur. Postecoglou had admitted Tottenham could not afford any more fitness problems, but his understudies succumbed to the latest lacklustre loss in a woeful season that could end in the Australian's sacking regardless of the result against United. Before kick-off, Villa fans posed with a replica of the European Cup trophy the club won in 1982. That final triumph against Bayern Munich remains Villa's finest achievement, but this season's memorable run to the Champions League quarter-finals excited the club's supporters. For Villa to remain in contention for another campaign among Europe's elite, victory against Tottenham was essential. Tottenham captain Son Heung-min was back in the starting line-up after a month out injured and the South Korea forward went close early on, cutting in from the left flank for a curler that flashed over. Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez had to make an alert save to keep out Wilson Odobert's audacious back-heeled effort from Mathys Tel's cross. Emery's men hit back after those escapes and Morgan Rogers forced a superb save from Tottenham keeper Antonin Kinsky, who clawed away the midfielder's flick before it could bounce in. Villa's failure to make the breakthrough in the first half against a team with their minds elsewhere raised the tension levels after the interval, but Konsa eased the mounting anxiety in the 59th minute. John McGinn's corner was flicked on by Ollie Watkins and Konsa took advantage of Tottenham's slow response as he swept a composed finish past Kinsky. Villa went for the kill and Watkins' close-range shot was repelled by Kinsky's fine stop. Kamara put the result beyond doubt in the 73rd minute, taking Rogers' pass and lashing home from the edge of the area.

Slot could afford the luxury of a trip to Ibiza this week with the club's record-equalling 20th English top-flight title long since wrapped up. Liverpool head to Brighton and Hove Albion Monday before hosting Crystal Palace on the final day of the Premier League season. Their cruise to the title has allowed the Dutchman to make an early start on preparations for next season. Liverpool are reportedly closing in on a deal for Dutch full-back Frimpong as a replacement for Trent Alexander-Arnold, who will leave his boyhood club at the end of the season at the end of his contract. Frimpong's Leverkusen team-mate Florian Wirtz has also been linked with a move to Anfield. But Slot said he would not comment on potential signings until the deals were completed. ""We don't talk about players we want to bring in in public until the moment they sign,"" he told reporters Friday. ""Even if you are celebrating over there (in Ibiza), it doesn't mean the whole day you aren't thinking about something else. ""A larger part of my mind now is already into next season, than it would have been had the next two games still been decisive for us. ""It's a normal situation that my thoughts, if I'm on the couch tonight, are more into next season than they would have been if the games were still very important."" England right-back Alexander-Arnold may not be the only player to depart in the coming months. Caoimhin Kelleher, Kostas Tsimikas, Harvey Elliott, Darwin Nunez and Federico Chiesa are among those facing uncertain futures. Italy forward Chiesa has struggled to make an impact despite being the only new signing of Slot's first season in charge. But Slot insisted the former Juventus star has just been unfortunate to be up against the in-form Mohamed Salah, Luis Diaz and Cody Gakpo in the battle for one of the two wide attacking roles in his team. ""Unfortunately for him he is in competition with Mo Salah when it is about the right wing but I think he can also play as a left-winger, but he has Gakpo and Diaz,"" Slot said. ""Is he (Chiesa) good enough to play for us? Yes he is. I have always felt Diaz, Gakpo and Salah deserved the confidence I had in them and I hardly ever changed that set-up between the three of them.""",sports

Arteta's side have now gone five years without a trophy as they approach the end of a frustrating campaign marred by injuries to key forwards Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Jesus. That trio, as well as influential midfielder Martin Odegaard, all missed substantial chunks of the season as Arsenal failed to keep pace with Premier League champions Liverpool before losing the Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain. A new striker is top of Arteta's wish-list with Havertz, who has not played for almost four months, still the club's top scorer in the league with just nine goals. Arsenal are believed to have at least Â£100m ($132m) at their disposal for new players and have been linked with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Newcastle United's Alexander Isak. After failing to lure England striker Ollie Watkins from Aston Villa during the January transfer window, Arteta is willing to do whatever it takes to get a new striker in the summer. ""The thing is that the budget is like when you have your wedding, you plan your wedding with your wife and you give her a budget and never less, and it's always more,"" Arteta told reporters Friday. ""When you build a house it's always more. Normally this happens. And you prepare for different scenarios. Then unfortunate things happen. Sometimes we want a player and suddenly we have an injury or that player gets injured. ""There are so many variables that can happen but there is a budget. There is always an idea of what we can do, what we can improve, what the priorities are going to be and then let's see if we can do it."" Amid speculation this week that Arteta and Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta, who replaced Edu in March, have disagreed over which striker to pursue, the manager insisted their relationship is fine. ""Well, if that happens, that means that we cannot explain ourselves well enough, and we are not clear enough on what we want, and I guarantee you that hasn't happened,"" he said. ""It didn't happen in five and a half years with Edu, and I guarantee you it hasn't happened with Andrea. ""We have learned a lot and some of them (transfers) have worked really well and others have not. So we have to make sure that we make the right calls.Â  ""But we are all human beings and unfortunately, nobody has got a crystal ball here. ""But Andrea is someone who is very driven, very clear in his ideas, in his vision and how we want to achieve it.""

The world's richest cricket tournament was suspended last week because of a brief but deadly conflict between nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan. The competition will resume Saturday but faces losing several top stars for the closing stages because of clashes with the schedules of international teams including Australia, England and South Africa. Four days of drone, missile and artillery exchanges from May 7 left around 70 people, including dozens of civilians, dead on both sides of the border. Starc's Delhi Capitals were playing in Dharamshala when a match was abandoned because of what officials said was floodlight failure. Dharamshala is less than 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the town of Jammu, where explosions were reported hours earlier the same day. The stadium was swiftly evacuated and players including the 35-year old Starc whisked out of the ground in the team bus. Starc told the Capitals that he will not return, Australian media reported, freeing him up to focus on the build-up to his country's World Test Championship final against South Africa on June 11 at Lord's. There was no immediate confirmation from the Delhi team or the IPL. Australia captain Pat Cummins and star batter Travis Head will both return to India, but the plans of other Australians is unclear. The league's suspension has thrown its schedule off kilter, with the playoffs now starting later and the final moved back nine days to June 3. Gujarat Titans top the 10-team table and are almost sure to reach the playoffs starting May 29. But wicket-keeper Buttler will leave the team after the group stage and will be replaced by the Sri Lankan Kusal Mendis, allowing the Englishman to be available for the first One Day International against the West Indies. England all-rounders Jacob Bethell and Will Jacks, who play for Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Mumbai Indians respectively, are also expected to leave the IPL early, the BBC reported. South African players also look set to miss the playoff phase should their teams get there. South Africa has said its players must leave India by May 26 so they can prepare for the WTC final.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/football/381392/how-flick-s-barca-wrestled-laliga-back-from-real,How Flick's Barca wrestled LaLiga back from Real Madrid,"16 May 2025, 09:24 AM","Barca clinched the Spanish title Thursday for the 28th time in the club's history, but only the 2nd occasion in the last 6 years Barcelona clinched the Spanish title Thursday for the 28th time in the club's history, but only the second occasion in the last six years. Hansi Flick's hugely entertaining side beat Espanyol 2-0 to take the crown with two matches to spare. Letâs break down the ways the German coach helped the Catalan giants reclaim the Spanish throne from arch-rivals Real Madrid. Awesome attack Flick's thrilling attacking outfit this season have shredded nearly every side to cross their path. Barca scored 97 goals in 36 games to power to the title, 23 more than second-placed Real. A 7-0 thrashing of Valladolid in August set out their intentions, and they hit four goals or more in 13 league matches. The brilliant Lamine Yamal, still only 17, excelled, feeding veteran striker Robert Lewandowski and dynamic winger Raphinha. The Brazilian, who Flick convinced to stay at the club, had his best ever season and credits his coach with changing his career. Yamal provided the most assists in Spain with 13, while Lewandowski notched 25 goals and Raphinha got 18 while setting up nine himself. Flick's high defensive line has been a key feature of the team's approach, which sometimes costs them at the back, but largely keeps opponents under pressure, including Real in last weekend's Clasico. ""For 24 minutes Real Madrid didn't touch the ball in our half...how we press them when they have the ball, it's unbelievable...we can be very proud of that,"" said Flick. Â  Mentality shift Flick's predecessor Xavi Hernandez made every excuse under the sun - and even including the sun - last season as Barca failed to win a single trophy. This year the Catalans claimed a domestic treble and Flick has largely insisted on avoiding blaming external factors when his team has struggled. That helped Barca players realise that what they achieve, or not, is up to them and has given them the strength to turn around adverse situations. Barca have pulled off several impressive comebacks this season, including from two goals down against Real to triumph 4-3 in the most recent Clasico on May 11. ""The team's mentality is incredible,"" said Flick after securing a fourth Clasico victory from four meetings this season. Furthermore the team no longer looks weighed down by expectations or pressure and instead are focused on enjoying themselves on the pitch - contributing to their attractive, flair-filled football. Perfect Pedri Pedri Gonzalez has a strong case for being the world's best midfielder right now and after injury-ravaged years him staying fit for the whole season has been vital for Barca. ""For me, Pedri is absolutely incredible - I'm on my knees for him,"" said former Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger. The Canary Islander, 22, has been the heartbeat of Flick's Barca, both in an attacking sense but also defensively, given the team operates without a holding midfielder following injuries to Marc Bernal and Marc Casado. Pedri's lithe form and quick-thinking allows him to get out of trouble quickly and helps Barca spring forward on the counter. Levels raised Flick boosted Barca's fitness levels and confidence across the board and his faith in players who struggled last season has been paid back in spades. The German insisted on keeping Eric Garcia and the centre-back has impressed when given opportunities, even playing out of position. Ferran Torres has helped the stellar forward trio rest and is the team's third top goalscorer and third top assist provider in LaLiga. Most importantly, Inigo Martinez struggled last season but has been a cornerstone of the defence alongside teenager Pau Cubarsi, becoming a true leader. Winter blues bounce-back Despite an excellent start to the season, in November and December last year Barca slumped. The Catalans won just once in a seven-match spell in that period, losing against minnows Leganes and Las Palmas at home. Their lead crumbled, with Atletico usurping them after beating Barca just before Christmas. Flick took action, deploying the fit-again Frenkie de Jong in midfield over Casado and installing Wojciech Szczesny in goal in place of Inaki Pena. Barca came back strongly and went on a run of 24 matches unbeaten over all competitions to get back in the driving seat for the title.",sports

""I just didn't know how tough it was going to be,"" he admitted at Imola ahead of this weekend's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. ""I knew it was going to be challenging and it's as challenging as it could ever be on all fronts."" After six races this year, he is still seeking a first podium finish in a Grand Prix and is seventh in the drivers' title race behind Kimi Antonelli, the Italian teenager who replaced him at Mercedes.Â  Hamilton cut a low-key figure on arrival in the paddock at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, the team's home circuit, and conceded that ""thereâs still a lot of work that needs to be done"" if he is to revive his form.Â  ""The championship?"" he said. ""There's still a long, long way to go. From all my years of experience, when youâre over 100 points behind at this point in the season, with a car that's up against a car (McLaren) that is dominant, you have to assume that you're not necessarily fighting for a championship win. ""But things can turn around."" Hamilton trails series leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren by 90 points. Ferrari plan to add an upgrade package to their car this weekend with a major one expected in Spain in two weeks' time, but Hamilton said he is unsure of their value or potential. ""At the moment, we don't know, but we want to get closer and we can't shut the door on any ideas. We have to keep our eyes and our heads up and stay vigilant.Â  ""We have to push with the expectation and goal of winning, finding the tenths to turn things around. You have to believe it."" Teammate Charles Leclerc withdrew from his media duties Thursday due to illness. In a statement Ferrari confirmed that the Monegasque driver was out of sorts but was expected to be fit to drive Friday.Â  ""Charles is feeling unwell and will not be coming to the track,"" it said. ""He will rest and focus on recovering and we expect him to be in the car."" Leclerc's absence added to the Italian team's woes ahead of their first âhomeâ race of the season. Ferrari, with marquee signing Hamilton struggling to shine, are already 152 points adrift of leaders McLaren in the constructors' championship after finishing last season only 14 points behind them. After six races, they have only registered one podium finish â Leclerc taking third place at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in April â and one sprint victory, by Hamilton in China. Leclerc is in his seventh year with Ferrari after joining from Sauber in 2018 and is widely thought to be one of the fastest drivers in the paddock, but without a car to match his talents.Â  He has won eight Grands Prix with Ferrari and claimed 44 podium finishes and 26 pole positions, but he has been unable to overcome the dominance of four-time champion Max Verstappen and Red Bull in the âground effectâ era.",sports

The Belgian's trophy-littered decade in Manchester will come to an end at the conclusion of the Premier League season. But Wembley's showpiece is the 33-year old's final chance to lift silverware at the club where he grew into one of world's best players. A six-time Premier League winner, De Bruyne could add a third FA Cup to his five League Cups and 2023 Champions League win with City. He has expressed his ""surprise"" that City did not seek to extend his stay, filled with the belief that he can still perform at the highest level. De Bruyne rolled back the years when City rallied from 2-0 down to thrash Palace 5-2 just last month with a goal and an assist. City will be hoping for more of the same to give him a fitting farewell and save some face from a season to forget for Pep Guardiola's men. After an unprecedented run of four consecutive Premier League titles, City are 18 points adrift of champions Liverpool and embroiled in a battle just to finish in the top five to secure a place in next season's Champions League. De Bruyne's decline has played a factor in City's downturn. Of his 108 goals and 177 assists for the club in 419 appearances, only six and eight respectively have come this season. However, he remains ""irreplaceable"" due to his impact in City's rise to being the dominant force in English football, according to the club's prolific striker Erling Haaland. ""To get the balls from him is a dream,"" said Haaland. ""It has been really special playing with him. Such a joy, and I am going to do everything I can to have this joy in the last few games. ""The future will be different with different players. When Kevin leaves we will need someone to replace him, although Kevin is irreplaceable in so many ways."" Guardiola has appeared almost apologetic for overlooking De Bruyne at times this season as he searched for solutions to fill the gaps in City's ageing midfield. ""The gratitude I have, we have, is huge,"" said Guardiola. ""Kevin is the player in the history of the club with the most titles and that defines what Kevin has done with us."" A giant mural of De Bruyne alongside his trophy haul as a City player was unveiled in Manchester city centre Thursday. Guardiola has suggested a statue outside the club's Etihad Stadium is also just a matter of time. But after a decade most characterised by a relentless thirst to keep on winning, the most fitting tribute would be for De Bruyne to go out with another medal around his neck. ""The whole team only has one thought and thatâs to try and get the trophy and to make the day special for Kevin,"" said City midfielder Mateo Kovacic. ""For what heâs done, he deserves to leave like a champion which he obviously is. ""He is a massive figure in Cityâs success, and he will be remembered as one of the best.""",sports

LA 2028 will see cricket returning to the Olympics for the first time since 1900, with a six-team Twenty20 event in both the men's and women's game set to be included in the programme. The ICC, cricket's global governing body, have yet to announce the qualification process but there are concerns in the West Indies, long one of the sport's established major international teams and the one closest geographically to Los Angeles, that their constituent countries could be excluded. That's because while the likes of Barbados, Jamaica - the home of Games sprint great Usain Bolt - Antigua and Barbuda and Trinidad and Tobago compete under the West Indies banner when it comes to international cricket, those territories are all individual entities at an Olympics. So if cricket qualification for LA 2028 is to be decided primarily on the basis of world rankings, the event could go ahead without any Caribbean involvement at all. ""All we are asking is that our individual nations' exceptional Olympic legacy be considered in the conversation,"" CWI chief executive Chris Dehring said Thursday.Â  ""Our nations have proudly flown their individual flags atop Olympic podiums as perennial gold medallists.Â  ""Now, with cricket's inclusion, we must ensure that our cricketers are not shut out of history. We are ready to collaborate. We are ready to compete. But above all, we are asking for fairness."" CWI appear to accept there is no prospect of the International Olympic Committee allowing a West Indies team to compete at LA 2028, even though their men's side were T20 world champions in 2012 and 2016 - when the women took the equivalent female global title. Â  But in a letter to the ICC, CWI suggested two possible routes for regional representation. The first would see an inter-Caribbean qualifying tournament should the West Indies men or women find themselves in a qualifying position, allowing the winner to take the region's spot.In the second, a dedicated regional qualifying process involving each of the West Indies independent nations would take place. CWI president Kishore Shallow added: ""The Caribbean has always punched above its weight at the Olympics, inspiring the world with our athletic brilliance. ""Cricket's return to the Games in 2028 must not exclude our young cricketers from the same dream that has inspired our athletes.""",sports

""Youri and Marcus are not available and Jacob Ramsey is suspended,"" Villa manager Unai Emery said Thursday. ""We have to do each step forward, testing and analysing how they are recovering. ""I don't know if they will be available physically (next week), because Marcus can't play next week. ""But they are working every day and they are feeling better."" The Tottenham game was moved to Friday night following Spurs' request for more time to prepare for Wednesday's Europa League final in Bilbao against another Premier League team in Manchester United. Villa were not happy with that decision and concerns have been raised that Spurs' priority Friday will be to avoid injury. But Emery expects the north London club, a lowly 17th in the Premier League table, to be competitive at Villa Park. ""They are trying to manage to play Premier League and Europa League, how they are performing in the Europa League is really fantastic,"" the Spaniard added. ""They are in the final...they are going to play with their better players, they are going to try and compete in getting the best performances to get ready for the final."" Sixth-placed Villa are chasing Chelsea, Manchester City and Newcastle United as they bid to secure Champions League qualification for a second successive season, with the top five from the Premier League entering next term's event. ""I wish to play, I don't want holiday because we are in a very good moment after a long season,"" Emery said.Â  ""Now we are very, very motivated, very excited to play in Villa Park (Friday) for our objectives we have in front of us to play again in Europe. ""It is not in our hands, but we can have some chance to play Champions League again. We are focusing on Tottenham.""",sports

The 33-year old is set to return in a one-off Test against Zimbabwe in Nottingham next week. Stokes has not played since tearing his hamstring in New Zealand in December. But having rushed back from a similar injury in the past, he has taken a longer period of downtime to get his recovery right. ""I've worked incredibly hard on all aspects of everything, from my cricket to fitness, and know I'm going to be in a position when I am back on the field to potentially be in physically the best possible shape I have been in,"" Stokes told Sky Sports. ""I feel great. Training and playing are completely different. No matter what you do at training, you cannot replicate the intensity your body is put through in a game.

City were also dumped out of the Champions League before the last 16 for the first time in 12 years by Real Madrid in the play-off round. ""This season has been tough,"" Haaland told the BBC.

FIFA President Infantino's belated arrival at the global governing body's annual meeting caused a delay of more than two hours. Several representatives from European football associations - including UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin - cut short their attendance after Infantino called a recess at the event taking place in Luque, outside Asuncion. UEFA issued a strongly worded statement following the walkout, describing the disruption caused by Infantino's late arrival as ""deeply regrettable"", accusing the FIFA chief of putting his ""private political interests"" ahead of the sport. ""The FIFA congress is one of the most important meetings in world football, where all the 211 nations in the world's game gather to discuss issues that affect the sport right across the world,"" the UEFA statement read. ""To have the timetable changed at the last minute for what appears to be simply to accommodate private political interests, does the game no service and appears to put its interests second. ""We are all in post to serve football; from the streets to the podium, and UEFA members of the FIFA Council felt the need on this occasion to make a point that the game comes first and to leave as originally scheduled."" Norwegian Football Federation president Lise Klaveness also expressed dismay at Infantino in a statement circulated to reporters, describing the incident as ""disappointing and concerning."" Infantino for his part issued an apology for his tardiness in remarks to the congress before the delegates left. Infantino blamed flight problems for his late arrival but stressed the importance of attending the meetings in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the hosts of the 2022 and 2034 World Cups respectively. ""As FIFA president, my responsibility is to make decisions in the best interests of the organization (...) I felt I had to be there to represent football and all of you,"" Infantino said of his visit to the Gulf. The FIFA leader accompanied Trump - who he visited last week at the White House - on his tour of both countries. The United States will take centre stage for FIFA over the coming years, hosting next month's inaugural Club World Cup before staging the 2026 World Cup with Canada and Mexico next year, with the Women's World Cup in 2031. FIFA Secretary General Mattias Grafstrom declined to elaborate on Infantino's late arrival following the meeting. ""I have no comment on that; he explained the reasons why it was delayed. He had important matters to discuss. We had a great Congress,"" he told reporters. Thursday's meeting wrapped with no major decisions taken. Alejandro Dominguez, the head of South American federation CONMEBOL, meanwhile used the occasion to comment on preparations for the 2030 World Cup. Dominguez, who has recently pushed a controversial proposal for the tournament to be expanded from 48 to 64 teams, said he believed ""no-one"" should be left out of the event, which marks the World Cup's centenary. ""A World Cup is the most popular celebration on planet Earth, and no one should be left out of that celebration,"" Dominguez said, without explicitly mentioning his idea of expansion. Dominguez's proposal - which would allow for more matches to be held in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay while the bulk of games would remain in Spain, Morocco and Portugal - has met with stiff opposition throughout the football world. The presidents of the ruling football bodies in Europe, Asia and Central America, the Caribbean, and North America have all spoken out against expansion. ""I'm not inviting you to change your position, but rather to reflect together on creating something worthy of history,"" Dominguez said.",sports
https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/football/381378/teenager-yamal-the-jewel-in-dominant-barca-s-liga,Teenager Yamal the jewel in dominant Barca's Liga crown,"16 May 2025, 05:46 AM","At just 17 years old Yamal now has 2 LaLiga titles to his name - the same as Cristiano managed in 9 years at Real At just 17 years old Lamine Yamal now has two LaLiga titles to his name - the same as Cristiano Ronaldo managed in nine years at Real Madrid. While his participation in the first was limited to a single brief cameo as a record-breaking 15-year old debutant, the winger has been a chief architect of Barcelona's success this season. It was fitting he should make the breakthrough against Espanyol Thursday with a sensational curling effort as Barca clinched the title. Yamal's breathtaking displays have brought a vibrancy and life back to Barca that had been lacking since the club's biggest icon, Lionel Messi, departed in 2021. Former Barca coach Xavi Hernandez brought Yamal on for the final seven minutes of a win over Real Betis in April 2023 at Camp Nou, as the Catalans went on to win the league for the first time since 2019. It was a false dawn for a dutiful but dull Barca side, which ended the next season trophyless, precipitating Xavi's exit. Real's LaLiga and Champions League double left Barca soul searching, with Yamal's growth the only bright spot. By early 2024 the fast dribbling, immensely skillful winger had emerged as the team's key attacker - albeit one still lacking in consistency. Spain coach Luis de la Fuente placed his faith in the teenager's talent, saying Yamal was ""touched by the magic wand of God"", and he excelled in their Euro 2024 triumph. A good omen then for incoming Barca coach Hansi Flick, whose free-flowing attacking style clicked with Yamal, as well as veteran striker Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha on the left flank. Yamal won the right-wing position, which was the Brazilian dynamo's preferred role, but Raphinha was happy to shift to accommodate him. ""Seeing him come on in this stadium, with all these people, is incredible,"" said Raphinha after Yamal's debut, in front of 90,000 fans. ""He will be very important for the club."" Raphinha was right, and it happened far quicker than he or Yamal could have reasonably expected. ""I left my fear in the park in (my hometown) Mataro,"" said Yamal, before playing in the recent Champions League semi-final against Inter Milan, where he produced two sensational displays as Barca came up fractionally short. Inter scraped through 7-6 on aggregate but their coach Simone Inzaghi labelled Yamal a ""phenomenon"", who only comes along ""every 50 years"". With 13 assists Yamal has the most in LaLiga, and is the top dribbler, with nearly double the amount of his closest contender, Sevilla's Dodi Lukebakio. ""The mentality of my team is unbelievable,"" said Flick after Barca beat Real 4-3 Sunday to virtually seal their Liga triumph. Yamal's irrepressible teen spirit is a big factor, with the youngster undaunted when Barca fall behind. He thrived in all four Clasicos this season, as Barca triumphed each time. They won the Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup by beating Real in finals earlier in 2025, before completing a domestic treble with LaLiga. ""He's not a kid,"" said Flick, after Barca returned from two goals down against Real, inspired by Yamal, who gestured for calm when his team were up against the wall. ""He has the self-confidence, the belief in what he can do."" The winger remembers his roots and celebrates goals by signalling the 304 postcode of his neighbourhood Rocafonda. ""Three trophies for Barca, no trophies for Real Madrid, four Clasicos won by Barca,"" joked Barca great Hristo Stoichkov. Yamal is not afraid of a pithy jibe at rivals himself, making him a hit on social media and cementing his fan favourite status - his No 19 shirt is the top seller. The winger will soon put pen to paper on a new Barca contract when he turns 18 in July. He marked his 17th birthday by winning Euro 2024 the next day, and this year he will celebrate by committing his future to the club he has been linked with since birth. Yamal joined Barca's feted La Masia youth academy aged seven, but as a baby remarkably was photographed being bathed by Messi for a charity calendar project. The teenager eschews comparisons to Barca's best ever player and the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, yet they just keep coming. With Barca out of the Champions League, Yamal's hopes of winning the coveted individual award are dented but he might not have to wait long. ""I'm really happy that this talent which comes along every 50 years plays for Barca,"" said Flick.",sports

The decision marks a new blow to Brazilian football, which celebrated some rare good news just four days ago with the announcement that Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti will take the reins of the national team later this month. The Rio court said one of the signatories of Rodrigues' 2025 contract had been mentally unfit to sign, meaning there had been ""possible forgery."" As a result, the judge ruled in a judgment consulted by Agence France Presse, the employment agreement between Rodrigues and the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), was ""null"" and void. The judge also ordered that the federation hold new leadership elections. Rodrigues, the first black president of the CBF, told journalists at a FIFA meeting in Asuncion Thursday, ahead of the ruling, he had ""absolute certainty"" the document was valid. The 71-year old had already been temporarily suspended in 2023 after a court found irregularities with his 2022 election, but was reinstated on orders of a Supreme Court judge after FIFA threatened sanctions against Brazilian football. FIFA and the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) had refused to accept Rodrigues' 2023 ouster, warning the CBF it could be barred from international competitions if it allowed external interference in its affairs. Rodrigues had been leading negotiations to sign Real boss Ancelotti as coach, a bid that fell apart at the time. Ancelotti, whom Rodrigues has hailed as the ""greatest coach in history,"" was finally appointed to the job of Selecao coach Monday. In March, Rodrigues was unanimously reelected to his post until 2030, as the sole remaining candidate after former star forward Ronaldo pulled out of the running. Weeks later, however, Rodrigues found himself again in hot water following an investigation by Brazilian magazine Piaui into the workings of the CBF. The article claimed Rodrigues bought the support of leaders of regional football federations towards his election by giving them a big salary boost. The CBF had been hoping that landing Ancelotti, who won the Champions League twice with AC Milan, would help turn the page on a bruising period for Brazil, still reeling from its historic 4-1 thrashing by Argentina in March. The team's last coach Dorival Junior was sacked over that performance. The record five-time World Cup winners are languishing in fourth place on the South American qualifying table for next year's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada.",sports

Despite his joy at winning the league, Flick also thought about some negative moments during the season, including the shock death of club doctor Carles Minarro in March. ""Carles is now here,"" said Flick, pointing towards the ceiling. ""He (would be) very proud about our team, what (we) saw in the last couple of months, so we think about him always.

American Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match after pulling through 7-6 (7/3), 4-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a match that lasted over three-and-a-half hours. Ruud was supposed to be Sinner's toughest test in Rome since he came back from his three-month doping ban, as the Norwegian came into the match in hot form on clay after winning in Madrid earlier this month.Â  In his previous matches Sinner looked to be still finding his feet after his suspension, accepted from the World Anti-Doping Agency for testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year. But the 23-year old demolished sixth seed Ruud in just over an hour with an ominous display of tennis, his domination such that the home fans at the packed centre court, seemingly out of sympathy, began to cheer the rare points that Ruud won. ""I was feeling great on court. I think we all saw that,"" said Sinner. ""How I felt was very, very positive signs for me...I was serving well and also returning well. Moving great on the court, so I'm very happy about that."" Ruud even got the loudest celebration of the match when he held his serve for the only time, in game three of the second set, holding his arms aloft in ironic joy. ""He was just everywhere...it's just like playing a wall that you know shoots hundred miles an hour balls at you all the time,"" said a bewildered Ruud. Tommy Paul, a 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 winner over Hubert Hurkacz in the day's first match, will have wondered what on earth he can do to stop Sinner if the Italian brings that form to Friday's last-four clash. Sinner won the first set in just 27 minutes, giving up only seven points as he stalked the court with intent, dressed all in black as he has been all week. And he then maintained his record of not dropping a set in the tournament to not so much stroll as smash into the last four, and send a message to Carlos Alcaraz. Spaniard Alcaraz, Sinner's key Grand Slam rival ahead of the French Open, will contest the other semi-final with Lorenzo Musetti Friday afternoon, with the blockbuster final tennis fans wanted still on. Gauff prevailed on a centre court left mostly empty by fans who headed for the exits in large numbers after watching Sinner's tennis clinic. Former US Open winner Gauff won her third straight match against Olympic gold medallist Zheng, after coming through a tie in which she made 15 double faults on serve and there were a combined total of 156 unforced errors. The 21-year old is looking for her first title of the season after losing the Madrid final to Sabalenka, and against home hope Paolini will find herself in a much fiercer atmosphere than the soporific crowd which stayed till past midnight to watch her reach her second final of the year. ""I told myself I'm ready to go home,"" said an exhausted Gauff.Â  ""It was tough for me, finding my rhythm especially at night, it was so slow, I just tried to stay in there. ""I was frustrated. She forced me to get out of my comfort zone."" Sixth seed Paolini is the third Italian woman to reach the Foro Italico final, and the first since her doubles partner Sara Errani was thumped by Serena Williams in 2014. Late bloomer Paolini, 29, will have a chance to be the first woman from the Mediterranean nation to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985, after beating Peyton Stearns 7-5, 6-1. ""It's a privilege to be in this position. I matured late as a tennis player but everyone has their own path. Some mature earlier and some later,"" said Paolini. ""I'm just enjoying it without thinking too much about the past."" Paolini could yet win both the singles and women's doubles tournaments, with her and Errani taking on Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider in the semi-finals Friday.",sports

Yamal's effort and Fermin Lopez's goal took Hansi Flick's side seven points clear of Los Blancos with two matches remaining, to clinch Barca's 28th title and complete a superb domestic treble. Only the Champions League escaped an exciting young Barca side this season, as they won the league for the second time in six years, at Espanyol's ground again just as in 2023. Back then, celebrating Barca players were chased from the field by angry home supporters but this time Espanyol turned on the sprinklers to soak the jubilant visitors, who headed down the tunnel quickly. Yamal opened the scoring after 53 minutes of a tense derby clash with a brilliant curling effort, before Lopez added another in the 95th minute to secure victory. ""It's time to celebrate,"" said Barca coach Flick, who said he would demand even more from his team next season. ""It's in our DNA (to want to learn), it's normal, and this is what I want from the players, that they always try to get better and they have this hunger, it's crucial."" Outside the stadium before the match several Espanyol fans were hit by a car which drove into a big crowd, although none were seriously injured and police said it appeared to be an accident. Barca were seconds away from sealing their title triumph Wednesday but Real snatched a 95th-minute winner against Mallorca to delay the inevitable. Flick's side started slowly in Cornella, with Espanyol, 16th, looking dangerous on the counter-attack and keen to secure their top-flight survival. Wojciech Szczesny made a fine save to deny Javi Puado who broke through on goal in Espanyol's best chance of the opening period. Barca dominated the ball but failed to create any clear opportunities themselves in the first half. The Catalan giants have often blown teams away this season, approaching a century of goals in LaLiga, but with the title on the line and a hostile crowd against them, they needed something special to break through. That came from 17-year old wing wizard Yamal, who zipped inside off the right flank and unleashed a rocket into the top corner from outside the box, in a replica of his goal for Spain against France in the Euro 2024 semi-finals. It was the teenager's eighth LaLiga strike of the season but with goals in both matches against rivals Real and also in the visit to face Atletico Madrid, he has a penchant for the big occasion. ""I don't know what to say about Lamine, he scored an amazing goal, he's had an amazing season,"" said Lopez. Barca's superb display in Sunday's Clasico, in which they beat their rivals 4-3 in a thrilling battle, effectively won them the title. They still had to get it over the line against their neighbours, though, and that became easier when Leandro Cabrera was sent off for an elbow into Yamal's stomach. Even though they had a player fewer, Espanyol pressured Barca heavily until Lopez drilled past Joan Garcia to end the hosts' resistance. Espanyol fans pelted Barca players with bottles as they celebrated the goal, but as the league's youngest squad wrapped up a title that most believed was unlikely at best after Kylian Mbappe's arrival at last year's champions Real, they did not care. ""On the pitch it was clear we could not celebrate there...two years ago (there was trouble),"" Flick told reporters.

Los Blancos cut the gap on the Catalan giants to four points ahead of Barca's visit to neighbours Espanyol Thursday, where they can wrap up the title with a victory. Trailing for much of the game after Martin Valjent's 11th-minute opener, two second-half goals for Real ensured the arch-rivals did not claim their 28th LaLiga title just yet. Real needed to win to deny Barca and Kylian Mbappe's equaliser and Jacobo Ramon's 95th-minute strike allowed them to do just that. Los Blancos' defeat by Barca Sunday in the Clasico left the Catalans on the brink of the title but Carlo Ancelotti's side showed fighting spirit in the final stages against Mallorca. ""The team played very well, it fought a lot, played with a lot of intensity and it was a totally deserved victory,"" said Ancelotti. ""We are happy because we want to finish the season well and this game didn't start well but afterwards we did very well in all senses."" Real coach Ancelotti is departing to take charge of the Brazilian national team at the end of a disappointing season in the Spanish capital, and has two games left in his post. The Italian's Real side, riddled with injury problems, were without Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes among other star names as Mallorca visited the Santiago Bernabeu. ""Having 12 players injured is very strange, we were able to overcome the absences with a good attitude, individually and as a group,"" added Ancelotti. The islanders, ninth, are hoping for European football for the first time since 2004 and put up a strong performance. Realâs 18-year old striker Endrick, whom Ancelotti may call up for Brazil in the future, came close early on but Leo Roman tipped his effort away. Mallorca took an early lead when Valjent received the ball on the right of the box in an ocean of space. The defender took his shot early and beat Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, making his 200th LaLiga appearance. Roman made a fine save to thwart England international Jude Bellingham as Real pushed for an equaliser. The stopper, who also excelled for Mallorca in a recent narrow defeat at Barca, denied Mbappe and then Fede Valverde before the break. Eventually Mbappe found a breakthrough for Real after 68 minutes, with some superb footwork to escape three Mallorca players trying to shut him down, and he drilled past Roman. It was Mbappe's 40th goal of a productive season on a personal level, although his team are set to end it without a major trophy and having been beaten four times by Barca across all competitions. Mateu Morey should have put Mallorca back ahead almost instantly after a Jacobo error, but Courtois denied him one-on-one. Roman produced yet another fine save from Arda Guler's drive before Valjent headed Mbappe's effort off the line and to safety with the goalkeeper out of position. It looked like despite Realâs efforts they were not going to find a winner but 20-year old defender Jacobo lifted a dropping ball over Roman's head as the Mallorca defence hesitated. Barca took 40 shots in their 1-0 win over Mallorca in April and Real produced 39. ""Leo Roman had a great game,"" said his opposite number Courtois. ""(Jacobo) was confident and in the end he scored that goal...it's very good for the youth academy, there are a lot of kids trying to get through. ""When they have to be there, they are, we Madrid fans have to be proud of the academy.""

The raid on Medidom was ordered to find evidence relevant to the ongoing trial of seven medical professionals in charge of Maradona's care when he died at home aged 60 while recovering from brain surgery for a blood clot. A police source told Agence France Presse that officers arrived at Medidom's offices in Buenos Aires only to discover it had moved years ago. A raid at the new address is being planned. This is the second such raid of a medical establishment linked to the case, the first having been the Olivos Clinic in Buenos Aires where Maradona was operated on in November 2020. His seven-person medical team is on trial for what prosecutors have called the ""horror theater"" of the final days of his life, at home in the Buenos Aires suburb of Tigre.

But with the F1 circus pitching its Big Top in Europe for the first time this season with a âtriple-headerâ of races, as much attention will be focused on Ferrari's struggles as on dominant leaders McLaren or Red Bull's defending four-time champion Max Verstappen. After six unimpressive outings in the first six races, the Italian team and their marquee signing seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton appear in front of the âtifosiâ for the first time on home soil at Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari.Â  For Hamilton and team-mate Charles Leclerc, it has been a disappointing opening spell with the Briton, in particular, struggling to find any real pace and performance in his Ferrari â and the team promising a series of upgrades to tackle the SF25's problems.Â  Hamilton did win the Sprint in Shanghai but has yet to secure a podium finish with Ferrari in a Grand Prix and the team are already 152 points adrift of Piastri's McLaren outfit. In Miami, he and Leclerc were left scrapping over seventh place.Â  ""On my side, this year, we have gone in quite extreme directions in terms of set-up to extract a bit more from the car,"" said Leclerc, who is in his seventh year with Ferrari. ""And it is always very difficult to compare driversâ settings to explain things."" For Hamilton, it has been a tough experience and this week he abandoned the distractions of social media by unfollowing everyone on Instagram where he has nearly 40m followers.Â  That cancellation included Ferrari and his own dog Roscoe. As Hamilton debuts in red in Italy, his successor at Mercedes, 18-year old Italian Kimi Antonelli, makes his first home appearance with the âSilver Arrowsâ who, like most teams, will bring an upgraded package to the cramped and classic track squeezed between town, river and rolling vineyards.Â  ""He grew up in Bologna, nearby, and this will be a special occasion for him,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. ""But it's also a race like any other that is worth 25 points and that's all that counts at the end."" As the youngest driver to take an F1 pole position, for a sprint race, to set a fastest lap and to lead a race, Antonelli has made a sensational start alongside George Russell.Â  But it is Piastri who has impressed the most with his poise and consistency to move 16 points clear of Lando Norris and 32 ahead of third-placed Verstappen who has been out-driving his car to stay in contention.Â  ""Weâre back in Europe with different types of circuit, different natures of circuit,"" said Red Bull team chief Christian Horner. ""McLaren have got the car to beat at the moment. That's quite clear and theyâre going to be tough to beat over the next few races."" After Imola's fast, flowing and technically-challenging circuit, where it is difficult to overtake, the roadshow moves on to the streets of Monaco where a new regulation demanding a mandatory second pit stop is being introduced, and then Spain. This weekend will also see the return of Argentine driver Franco Colapinto to F1 as he replaces Australian Jack Doohan at Alpine whose team boss Oliver Oakes resigned unexpectedly last week.

It was his first match since he announced last week that he would be leaving his boyhood club when his contract expires at the end of June, with Real Madrid his expected destination.

Liverpool right-back Alexander-Arnold confirmed his impending exit Monday ahead of a widely-expected move to Real Madrid. In his first game in front of Liverpool's fans at Anfield since his decision to quit his boyhood club, the Merseyside-born England star was subjected to audible jeers as he was introduced as a 67th-minute substitute against Arsenal. There were also some cheers for the 26-year old product of Liverpool's youth academy, who has won two Premier League titles and the Champions League with the Reds. But he was booed several times while in possession in the second half as Arsenal fought back from two goals down despite finishing with 10 men after Mikel Merino's late dismissal. Liverpool manager Arne Slot had said prior to the game he would not tell supporters how they should react to the player's announcement. Slot dropped Alexander-Arnold from his line-up as he looked to the future by starting with 21-year old Conor Bradley. The highly-rated Northern Irishman is viewed as the natural successor to Alexander-Arnold and the crowd sang his name during the game. ""There's a lot of emotion around it,"" Robertson said of the taunts for Alexander-Arnold. ""For Trent, it's not been an easy one. Of course it's not. But he's made the decision.Â  ""It's not nice to see a friend get booed, it wasn't nice. But as I said, we can't tell people how to act. ""I can't tell you how I feel about it, I'm extremely proud of him. I love him as a player, I love him as a friend. He will be missed as one of my best friends in the game."" Slot opted to toe a delicate line between supporting Alexander-Arnold and not angering Liverpool's fans. ""There were people who were not so happy, there were people who were happy for him. They clapped for him. A few of them booed,"" he said. ""I will always back my players, the ones I lead and wear the red shirt. ""It would not be fair to focus only on the Liverpool fans that booed. If they want to, it's fine but there were a lot of people that were really positive about him as well."" Slot said he would have no qualms about selecting Alexander-Arnold for Liverpool's final two games at Brighton and Hove Albion and against Crystal Palace at Anfield. ""The thing I consider is I want to win a game of football and if we think we can win with Trent, I owe it to his team-mates and to the fans, because they hired me to win as many games of football as possible,"" Slot said. ""And if I think there's a better chance of winning with Trent, then I will pick him. ""If I think it's a distraction or whatever can happen for us not to play a good game of football, then I might make another decision."" Alexander-Arnold is the latest Liverpool star to leave for Real after Steve McManaman and Michael Owen in 1999 and 2004 respectively. Neither have been able to completely heal the wounds caused by their defections to the Bernabeu. But former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher echoed Robertson's frustration with the reaction of Reds fans to Alexander-Arnold. ""That's the story of the game. That's what we will be talking about after the game, and the back pages of every newspaper,"" he said. ""I'm surprised how many. When you're in a crowd of 60,000, there's no doubt there's a lot of unhappy people at Liverpool about the situation, and I've said that's understandable. ""But for me, I don't believe that any player putting that red shirt on, going out to play for the club and trying to win them points or win them trophies should be booed.""",sports

The Catalans moved to the brink LaLiga glory with their victory at Olympic Stadium, opening a seven-point gap on second placed Real with three matches remaining.

Three days after United reached the Europa League final, they were brought back down to earth by another lowly side in the Hammers, with the London club recording their first top-flight win at Old Trafford since 2007. Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen scored the visitors' goals as United, once the undisputed kings of English football, suffered a 17th defeat in 36 league games this season to sit 16th. This latest lacklustre display angered Amorim, who has already given his team several public dressing downs since replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag as United manager in November. ""For me the biggest concern is that feeling that 'it's OK', and 'we cannot change our position so much so it's OK',"" Amorim said. ""That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it's the end of the world to lose a game at home."" The 40-year old Portuguese coach, previously in charge of Sporting Lisbon, added it was ""the most dangerous feeling that you have in a big club"", with United having not won the Premier League title since celebrated manager Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. Amorim, asked how it felt to see his side so low in the Premier League, replied: ""How a manager of Manchester United supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed and it's hard to accept."" And he said a Europa League final with fellow English strugglers Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao on May 21 could not distract from United's domestic woes. ""Everybody is thinking about the final,"" said Amorim. ""The final is not an issue in this moment in our club. We have bigger things to think (about) and we have to change a lot of things in the end of the season."" Amorim, who has overseen just six league wins since succeeding Ten Hag, said United ""need to change a lot of things during the summer"" and questioned his own future if he can't oversee a significant improvement. ""I don't want to talk about players,"" Amorim said. ""I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team. ""We need to change that and we need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave because we will not have a next season like this. If we start like this, or if the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different persons."" For the Hammers, victory ended an eight-game wait for a win. ""Very pleasing result, especially in the context of what we've been through,"" said West Ham manager Graham Potter. ""It's been a tough couple of months because results have not been what we've wanted. ""Performances haven't been as bad, but you know what it's like - if you don't get the results you have to suffer in the Premier League and that's what we had to do.""",sports

Kylian Mbappe scored a hat-trick but the Catalans came from two-goals down to win 4-3 and the margin of victory might have been larger still, were it not for some contentious refereeing calls in the final stages in Realâs favour. Coach Carlo Ancelotti understood early on this season that fitting last summer's marquee arrival Mbappe and established stars Vinicius Junior, Jude Bellingham and Rodrygo Goes in the same side was going to be difficult while keeping the team stable. After losing just twice across all competitions on the way to winning LaLiga and the Champions League in 2024, this year Real have suffered 14 defeats - four of those against Barca - and will end up without a major trophy. Defeat by Barca at Olympic Stadium Sunday leaves them seven points behind the Catalans with three matches left to play. That the Clasico was close at all came down to Mbappe, whose treble took him above Robert Lewandowski to lead Spain's scoring charts with 27 league goals. ""Mbappe was the only resistance,"" wrote newspaper Mundo Deportivo. ""Madrid faced the Clasico with one tank and 10 tin soldiers, and Barca knocked them all down."" Mbappe's goals also made him the club's top goalscorer in a first season at Real with 39, beating Ivan Zamorano's record of 37 set in 1993. ""The team's flagship figure is Mbappe,"" wrote AS, noting that although he has not been at his personal peak this season, he has still been one of the club's best players, and ""among the 'fantastic four', undoubtedly the standout"". Real conceded 16 goals in their four Clasico defeats by Barca this season, scoring seven, with Mbappe netting five of those goals. The French forward scored in every final Real played in, netting in European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup triumphs, as well as in the Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup defeats. By contrast, Vinicius and Bellingham did not score in any of the four games against Barca. ""The changing of the guard is real,"" added AS. ""Heading into next season the roadmap is clear: Mbappe and 24 others."" Mbappe failed to deliver in the Champions League against Atletico Madrid and then Arsenal as Real were eliminated in the quarter-finals, but his hat-trick against Manchester City was the kind of display Los Blancos expected from him. With the team built around him and a sturdier defence and midfield, Mbappe can take Real to the silverware they demand. ""He did well,"" said Ancelotti of Mbappe, pleased with the way the forward got in behind Barca's high line, but upset at his team's woeful defending. ""It was quite obvious that we defended badly,"" said the Italian bluntly. Ancelotti is set to depart at the end of the season to be replaced by Bayer Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso, who will inherit the puzzle of how to use Real's attacking stars effectively. With Vinicius and Rodrygo struggling for form for months and Bellingham's first season heroics long since faded, it is evident that Mbappe will spearhead Real's next project.",sports

A fixture clash looms after the lucrative Twenty20 tournament was suspended last week as a result of deadly military exchanges between India and Pakistan - the worst violence between the two nuclear-armed neighbours since 1999. The Board of Control for Cricket in India has decided to stage the 17 outstanding matches following a ceasefire agreement, with the tournament due to end on June 3. England play three ODIs against West Indies, on May 29, June 1 and June 3 - the first series since Harry Brook was appointed as their full-time white ball captain. England cricket chiefs are keen to show support for the BCCI but also want to put out a full-strength team.Â  As of Tuesday, they had taken no firm decision on how to respond to the latest developments.

The veteran Italian will become Selecao boss on May 26, the day after Realâs last LaLiga match of the campaign. The Spanish giants are yet to name a replacement, although Xabi Alonso is a strong favourite to take over after confirming he will leave Bayer Leverkusen. The Brazilian football federation (CBF) announced Ancelotti's appointment Monday, before any official confirmation from Real regarding Ancelotti's departure. ""The CBF issued that statement because I'll be the coach of Brazil from the 26th. Madrid will issue a statement whenever they want, there is no problem,"" Ancelotti told reporters on the eve of his team's match against Real Mallorca. ""I will be the coach of Brazil, which is a challenge, but until then, I'm the coach of Real Madrid and I want to finish in the best possible way. ""I'm focused on the final stretch of this spectacular adventure."" Ancelotti, who has won 15 trophies including three Champions League titles across two spells at Santiago Bernabeu, has endured a difficult final season in charge. Real's LaLiga title defence has faltered with Barcelona on the cusp of the title, while they also lost the Copa del Rey final to their arch rivals and were humbled in the Champions League quarter-finals by Arsenal. ""Football, like life, is an adventure that begins and ends,"" added the 65-year old, who also lifted the European Cup twice as AC Milan coach. ""I've always kept in mind that this would end. I've had a great time...but in everything in life there comes a time when it ends. ""My seriousness and professionalism demand that I finish well here... ""I've never had a problem with the club and I never will."" Realâs 4-3 loss to Barca Sunday in El Clasico left them seven points behind Hansi Flick's side with only three matches remaining. Barca would secure the title if Real fail to defeat Mallorca Wednesday. ""I've had a fantastic time here and I want to continue like this for the last two weeks I have left here,"" said Ancelotti when asked about criticism from the press over his team's performances this season. ""I've gotten the most out of myself and the titles speak for themselves.""

Conrad said there was an agreement that South Africa's players would return from India on May 26 - the day after the original date of the IPL final. This would enable them to have time to prepare for the Test final against Australia at Lord's in London from June 11 to 15. He said he did not expect that to change, despite the IPL being rescheduled to finish on June 3 after a postponement caused by recent hostilities between India and Pakistan. ""Our initial agreement with the IPL and the Indian board was that our players would return on the 26th,"" said Conrad. He cautioned that discussions between Cricket South Africa and the Indian board were still taking place. ""As it stands, we're not budging on this. We want our players back on the 26th."" Conrad and captain Temba Bavuma both expressed support for star fast bowler Kagiso Rabada, who will spearhead the bowling attack after serving a one-month ban for recreational drug use. ""I am thankful that the process that was followed was in line with world standards,"" said Conrad. ""I wasn't going to pre-empt anything and we allowed the process to run as it did.Â  ""KG (Rabada) is a massive player for us. The big thing for us was to close ranks around him and ensure that he is in a good space. ""He's served his sentence and all that I am interested in now is KG producing the sort of performances we know he is capable of."" Bavuma said he had had private talks with Rabada, who he described as a close friend. ""From a captaincy point of view, the process has passed and it's now a focus on the individual, the human, and making sure he gets the support he needs and that he will be in the best state to perform."" Asked whether he expected Rabada to face criticism or sledging from the Australians, Bavuma said the fast bowler had faced controversy before, notably in South Africa's most recent series against Australia in 2017/18. Rabada was initially suspended after a confrontation with Australian captain Steve Smith, who was himself banned after the ""sandpaper-gate"" Test at Newlands in Cape Town. Rabada appealed successfully against his ban and finished as player of the series. ""We saw how that series ended and how he performed,"" said Bavuma. But Bavuma admitted that the situation this time was different. ""There will be a lot of people who will point fingers at him, some who have skeletons in their own closet, but I am not one of those people."" Bavuma said he was fully fit after missing South Africa's domestic four-day series final in April because of a recurrence of an elbow injury. Batsman David Bedingham has recovered from a broken toe suffered while batting for Durham in an English county championship match against Yorkshire in April. Conrad said he expected South Africa to go into the final as underdogs but said that was purely on the basis of experience. ""When we play our best cricket we've every chance of beating Australia.

The 36-year old from Northern Ireland became only the sixth man to complete the career Slam by winning last month's Masters for his fifth major title, snapping a major win drought dating to 2014 with a victory that brought him to tears on the 18th green. ""I've achieved everything that I've wanted,"" McIlroy said Wednesday. ""I've done everything I've wanted to do in the game. I dreamed as a child of becoming the best player in the world and winning all the majors. I've done that. ""Everything beyond this, for however long I decide to play the game competitively, is a bonus."" McIlroy shuns watching videos of his victory, preferring to recall the emotions of a moment that still brings him to the verge of crying. ""I've tried not to watch it a lot because I want to remember the feelings,"" McIlroy said.Â  ""When I rewatch a lot of things back, I then just remember the visuals of the TV rather than what I was feeling and what I was seeing through my own eyes. ""But anytime I have, I well up. I still feel like I want to cry. ""I've never felt a release like that before and I might never feel a release like that again. That could be a once-in-a-lifetime thing, and it was a very cool moment."" For McIlroy, it's time to bask in the glow of success and not worry about creating more burdens, even at the PGA at Quail Hollow, where he has won four PGA Tour events. ""I think everyone saw how hard having a North Star is and being able to get over the line,"" McIlroy said. ""If I can just try to get the best out of myself each and every week, I know what my abilities are. And if I keep turning up and trying to do that, especially in these four big ones a year, I know I'll have my chances."" There are no major win total goals for McIlroy. There is only playing the game as best he can as often as possible. ""I'm never going to put a number on it. I've talked about trying to become the best European ever or the best international player ever or whatever that is,"" McIlroy said. ""I feel like I sort of burdened myself with the career Grand Slam stuff, and I want to enjoy this. I want to enjoy what I've achieved, and I want to enjoy the last decade or whatever of my career, and I don't want to burden myself by numbers or statistics. I just want to go and try to play the best golf I can."" Winning the career Slam has been even more than McIlroy dreamed it would be for him. ""It's everything I thought it would be,"" McIlroy said. ""The outpouring of support and congratulatory messages has been absolutely amazing. ""Everyone needs to have goals and dreams, and I've been able to do something that I dreamed of for a long time. I'm still going to set myself goals. I'm still going to try to achieve certain things. ""But I sit here knowing that that very well could be the highlight of my career. ""That's a very cool thing. I want to still create a lot of other highlights and high points, but I'm not sure if any other win will live up to what happened a few weeks ago."" Reigning US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau said he was shocked playing partner McIlroy never talked with him during the Masters final round. ""I don't know what he was expecting. We're trying to win the Masters. I'm not going to try to be his best mate out there,"" McIlroy said. ""I was focused on myself and what I needed to do. That's really all that it was.

The 23-year old Italian star only returned to the circuit last Saturday, at the Italian Open, after serving a three month doping ban.Â  Video released by the Vatican showed Sinner shaking the hand of the Chicago-born pope and presenting him with a racquet similar to his own. With a racquet in both men's hands, Sinner then whipped out a ball. ""Do you want to play a little bit?"" asked Sinner, dressed in a black suit.Â  Both men laughed, peering up at the gold fabric covered walls around them. ""We'd better leave it,"" joked the pope. Sinner was accompanied by members of his family and the president of the Italian Tennis Federation, Angelo Binaghi, during the visit. He also showed the pope the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup trophies won by Italy in 2024. The head of the Vatican's press office earlier said ""the pope's passion for tennis is well known"". The 69-year old pontiff likes not just to watch but also to play, according to reports.Â  In an interview after being made cardinal in 2023, the former missionary in Peru said: ""I consider myself an amateur tennis player.Â  ""Since I left Peru, I haven't had many opportunities to play, but I can't wait to get back on the court.""

""I'll come with (Andre) Agassi,"" he said.Â  ""As long as it's not Sinner,"" he joked.

HRW said ""scores of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia die in gruesome yet avoidable workplace-related accidents, including falling from buildings, electrocution, and even decapitation"". The NGO, which has studied nearly 50 cases of deaths in Saudi Arabia, said Saudi authorities had ""failed to adequately protect workers from preventable deaths, investigate workplace safety incidents, and ensure timely and adequate compensation for families"" including through life insurance policies and benefits to survivors. ""The risks of occupational deaths and injuries are further increasing as the Saudi government ramps up construction work for the 2034 World Cup as well as other 'giga-projects',"" HRW added. The Gulf kingdom was handed the right to host the 2034 World Cup at a FIFA Congress last December despite concerns about its human rights record, the risks to migrant labourers and criminalisation of same-sex relationships. It was the only candidate. The NGO called on FIFA to ensure all work-related deaths in Saudi Arabia are properly investigated and that bereaved families receive compensation. FIFA has committed to establishing a workers' welfare system, which it says includes ""dedicated mandatory standards and enforcement mechanisms applicable to all companies and workers involved in...World Cup-related construction and service delivery"" in Saudi Arabia.Â  But HRW said football's world governing body did not provide ""details on concrete measures to prevent, investigate, and compensate migrant worker deaths such as risk-based heat protection measures or life insurance"". The NGO claimed ""FIFA is knowingly risking yet another tournament that will unnecessarily come at a grave human cost"", referencing the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. Similar concerns over workers' welfare dogged Qatar ahead of its hosting of international football's showpiece tournament. Amnesty International and other rights groups claimed thousands of migrant workers died in the lead-up to the 2022 tournament, though Doha has said only 37 workers on World Cup projects perished - and only three in work-related accidents. HRW stated in its report that the majority of migrant worker deaths in Saudi Arabia are attributed to ""natural causes"" and are therefore neither investigated nor compensated. According to figures provided by the NGO, for example, 74% of 1,420 Indian migrant worker deaths recorded at the Indian embassy in Riyadh in 2023 were attributed to natural causes. HRW added ""even work-related death cases categorised as such in a migrant worker's death certificate are sometimes not compensated as they should be according to Saudi law and international labour standards"". ""In migrant death cases that are compensated, the process is long and burdensome,"" the report said, providing an example of one such compensation process that took a decade to be completed. ""My sons are 11 and 13 years old. When my husband died, they were 11 months and two years old. If we had received compensation right after his death, it would have provided so much relief,"" the wife of a deceased worker, who was not named, told HRW. In response to the report, FIFA shared with Agence France Presse a letter it sent last month to HRW from its secretary general Mattias Grafstrom. The letter says Saudi Arabia has ""in the past years been investing heavily in the development of its society and economy"", using international companies. Grafstrom notes that Saudi Arabia ""has taken significant steps to reform its labour laws since 2018"", including the abolition of parts of the kafala system which ties workers to their employers, and introducing standardised contracts for workers. The Saudi government, he says, has also committed to working with the United Nations' International Labour Organization ""on the further expansion and effective implementation of these reforms"". ""In line with its human rights commitments, FIFA seeks to play its part in ensuring strong protections for workers employed by third parties in the construction of FIFA World Cup sites,"" Grafstrom adds. AFP has also contacted the Saudi government for comment.",sports

Madrid Open winner Sabalenka was sent packing in the quarter-finals by Chinese eighth-seed Zheng Qinwen 6-4, 6-3. Third seed Alcaraz meanwhile produced what he called one of his best displays of the season to book a last four date with either reigning Rome champion Alexander Zverev or home hope Lorenzo Musetti, the day's final pairing on centre court at Foro Italico. His impressive win over Draper kept alive the Spaniard's chances of a third title of the season and also moved him up to No 2 in the world rankings behind Jannik Sinner. On top of that, Alcaraz bagged a top-two seeding at the French Open which begins later this month. ""I think I started pretty well and I ended the match pretty well as well,"" said the four-time Grand Slam winner in search of a first Rome crown. ""I lost focus a little bit in the second set but it wasn't (for) too long, so it was pretty good. Probably it was one of the most complete matches that I played this year."" Alcaraz had to be at his best to down fifth seed Draper, who put in another strong showing on clay in Italy after losing the Madrid Open final to Casper Ruud. The Briton lost control of the first set when after taking a two-game lead he was broken twice by Alcaraz who then took the lead in the match. And Alcaraz made sure of victory by saving two break points in a 10-minute game eight of the second set, before breaking Draper to love to go 5-4 ahead in the set and then serve out the match at the first time of asking. Ruud's attempt at a Madrid and Rome double has a Sinner-shaped obstacle in its way after the world No 7 won his postponed match with Jaume Munar 6-3, 6-4. ""Tomorrow will be one of the toughest matches of the year, probably,"" said sixth-seed Ruud of facing Sinner. ""I got beaten pretty bad by Jannik last time in Turin (at the Association of Tennis Professionals Finals)...Let's see, he's been looking good since the first match."" Sabalenka's stunning clay-court form deserted her as she fell in straight sets to Olympic gold medallist Zheng. It was seventh time lucky for the world No 8 as she at last got the better of her Belarusian opponent with a confident display under the lights in Rome. After surviving early pressure on her own serve, Zheng broke Sabalenka to take a 3-2 lead in the first set before serving out. Zheng then pounced in Sabalenka's first service game in the second frame to go up a break. Sabalenka showed determination to make gritty holds in the fifth and seventh games of the set, but she could not make inroads on Zheng's service as the 22-year old powered into the semis. ""It's been a long time I haven't arrived in semi-finals,"" Zheng told Sky Sports after securing her first semi-final appearance of the season. ""It was not easy for me because at the beginning of the year I got some struggle with my arm.Â  ""So right now I'm just perfectly in shape and trying to play better tennis all the time."" Zheng will meet Coco Gauff in the last four after the American earlier beat Mirra Andreeva 6-4, 7-6 (7/5). Gauff has guaranteed herself No 2 in the women's world rankings with her solid displays in Rome, where she saw off seventh seed Andreeva. Former US Open winner Gauff said she had ""a lot of confidence"" for the last four, where she will face an opponent against whom she holds a 2-0 record. Gauff, 21, is looking for her first title of the season ahead of Roland Garros, after losing the Madrid final to Sabalenka. Indian Wells champion Andreeva, at 18 years old the youngest woman to reach the last eight at Foro Italico since Gauff in 2021, put up surprisingly little resistance in a low-key first set. And Gauff had too much for her in the second, quickly responding to each of Andreeva's breaks of serve before coming through a tricky tie-break.",sports

A return to Europe's elite tournament is estimated to be worth at least Â£70m ($93m) to United and would allow Amorim more resources to rebuild his squad. ""For me the Champions League is more important,"" Amorim said at a press conference Wednesday.Â  ""For everything, to prepare the next season. ""We are supposed to be in the Champions League. Europa League here is not enough and you have to have that feeling here.Â  ""The best way to help us to get to the top in a few years is the Champions League. It is not the title, the trophy. ""The most important thing is how this title could help us to get back to the top faster."" A dramatic run to the final has salvaged a torrid start to Amorim's time at Old Trafford. Since taking charge in November, he has won just six of 25 Premier League games. The Portuguese coach has at times been brutal in the assessment of his team, including labelling them the worst in the club's history. However, he rejected suggestions he could resign if United compound a miserable season with defeat in Spain. ""I cannot see the team having these results, especially in the Premier League, and see nothing and not take the responsibility,"" added Amorim. ""It's just that I have a clear idea of what to do. I understand the problems of the team, so I'm far from quitting. ""What I'm saying is that we need to perform. In the future we need to perform or else they will change us."" Amorim confirmed reports that he will help fund travel for the families of his backroom staff to the final. United have made swinging cuts off the field in the year since British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe bought a minority stake in the club, including 250 redundancies with up to 200 more to come. Amorim said that negativity has played a part in United's struggles this season but the Europa League offers the chance for a much-needed boost. ""This season has been really tough on everybody. The results and also the changes in the staff. You can feel it in our club. ""We had so many bad results in the Premier League, so the environment is tough at the moment. But I guarantee you that when we are preparing a game in the Europa League, the environment is a little bit different and you can feel the excitement.""",sports

Miraz, who was also named Player of the Match in Chittagong, pipped Zimbabwe player Blessing Muzarabani and New Zealand's Ben Sears to clinch the award. ""It's an incredible honor to win the ICC Men's Player of the Month award. The ICC Awards are the ultimate recognition for any cricketer, and to receive this from a global vote means a lot to me,"" Miraz told the ICC in his immediate reaction. ""Moments like these remind me of my journey - being named Player of the Tournament in the 2016 ICC Under-19 World Cup was a massive encouragement early in my career, and this award feels just as special,"" he added. Further saying he is truly delighted to have won this trophy, he added: ""This award will be a big source of inspiration for me to keep giving my best and contributing to Bangladesh's success on the world stage.""

https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/football/381160/three-reasons-ancelotti-can-succeed-with-brazil,Three reasons Ancelotti can succeed with Brazil,"13 May 2025, 11:57 PM","Ancelotti will take the reins of the Brazil national team on May 26, aiming to lead the team to World Cup glory next year for the 1st time since 2002 Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti will take the reins of the Brazil national team on May 26, aiming to lead the team to World Cup glory next year for the first time since 2002. Previous coach Dorival Junior was sacked in March after a 4-1 thumping by rivals Argentina in qualifying. Here, let's consider three reasons he could prove successful with the record five-time world champions: Ancelotti, who has written a book named ""Quiet Leadership"", is known for his calm and warm character, making him an ideal candidate for one of football's highest pressure jobs. The Italian has demonstrated his ability to succeed in similar environments with some of Europe's biggest sides, including Real Madrid, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain. With Brazil's fiercest rivals Argentina reigning world champions, the pressure on Brazil to succeed in the 2026 World Cup will be higher than ever. Ancelotti is also set to be the first foreign manager to lead Brazil into a World Cup. However if anybody is cut out to thrive in - or despite - heavy scrutiny from fans and national media, it is the unflappable, avuncular Ancelotti. ""Ancelotti would be ideal because everyone, including opponents, respects him,"" said Brazil great Zico in 2023. ""He knows football and is aware that players are more important than tactics."" Ancelotti is considered a superb man-manager, which will allow him to get the best tune out of a national team rich in talent. With Neymar turning 34 ahead of the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada, there is a strong chance the forward and talisman of this Brazilian generation will not feature. He has made only nine appearances since rejoining Santos from Saudi club Al Hilal, continuing to struggle with injury problems. Instead Vinicius Junior will likely be Brazil's key figure, a player who has developed brilliantly under Ancelotti at Real. The Italian has helped the 24-year old turn from a figure of fun, because of his inconsistent end product, into one of the Spanish league's biggest stars. Rodrygo Goes has also won two Champions League titles with Ancelotti at Real, as has defender Eder Militao. Teenage forward Endrick, who has already scored three goals for Brazil, has made 35 appearances for Real this season, netting seven times in all competitions. Ancelotti is the only coach in history to win all five of Europe's biggest leagues and will find a new challenge in international football. The World Cup is the final puzzle piece left for Ancelotti to complete his glittering managerial career. Ancelotti won the Champions League twice as a player with AC Milan and twice more as a coach there, along with three further wins while in charge of Real - five triumphs puts him two ahead of any other manager. The 65-year old seemed to have fallen out of the elite after taking charge at Everton in 2019, but Real's surprise move to reappoint him in 2021 has been fruitful for both coach and club. Now Ancelotti sets his sights on glory with Brazil, and completing his personal trophy cabinet.",sports

Batting great Kohli and captain Rohit both retired from Tests in the past week, leaving Shubman Gill as the front-runner to lead a new-look India in England. The retirement last year of veteran spinner Ravichandran Ashwin leaves India without the backbone of the side that was formerly No 1 in the world Test rankings. Top-order batsman Gill is favourite to be given the task of starting India's rebuild with the five-Test England series, which begins on June 20 at Headingley. ""Gill looks like the heir apparent but his record overseas hasn't looked too great,"" veteran cricket journalist Ayaz Memon told Agence France Presse. The 25-year old Gill has scored 1,893 runs at an average of 35.05 in 32 Tests since his debut in 2020, with five hundreds.Â  But in 13 Tests away from home his average is only 29.5. Gill is likely to move up the order to open alongside the 23-year old Yashasvi Jaiswal, with big-hitting Shreyas Iyer in the frame to replace Kohli at the fall of the second wicket. Others who could be charged with the almost impossible task of following in all-time great Kohli's footsteps are Sarfaraz Khan, Rajat Patidar and Dhruv Jurel.Â  Wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant has also been mentioned as a future captain, but his current poor form and less-than-inspiring leadership of Lucknow Super Giants in the Indian Premier League are counting against his immediate elevation. Leading pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah was Rohit's deputy in Australia and led the team in two Tests, winning one, and was seen as another candidate for captain. But Bumrah has only recently returned to action after suffering a back injury during the final Test at Sydney in January. The five Tests in England are crammed into six weeks, meaning India will need to manage the workload of their pace attack by resting bowlers for one or more matches, effectively ruling Bumrah out of the captaincy debate. Team in transition Memon, who called Kohli's retirement ""a big moment in Indian cricket"", said there was enough strength in depth to fill the void left by Kohli, opener Rohit and Ashwin.Â  ""There are senior pros like (Mohammed) Shami, if he is in form and selected, and (Ravindra) Jadeja,"" said Memon.Â  ""The new crop of Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant, maybe Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Siraj look good. ""They could be looking for a young spinner, maybe Washington Sundar because Ashwin is not there."" Off-spinner Ashwin called an abrupt halt to his international career after playing the second Test in Adelaide last year. He ended his career with 537 wickets in 106 matches, eighth on the all-time list and behind only Anil Kumble for India, who had 619 dismissals. India's 1983 World Cup-winning all-rounder Sandeep Patil believes the new-look India could come out stronger after a period of transition. ""The two stalwarts, the two pillars of Indian cricket, have gone,"" Patil, who was chief selector when Kohli became captain in 2015, told The Times of India. ""It is time to rebuild. It will be a challenge for the national selectors, but I am sure we will find a solution.Â  ""If one player exits, the next one is ready.""",sports

Real had made the perfect start to what is expected to be the Italian coach's final Clasico at the helm. Mbappe earned a penalty when he was scythed down by Barca goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, although the Catalans complained in vain the French forward was offside in the build-up. The striker beat Szczesny, who dived the right way and got his fingers to it, but could not keep it out. In the 14th minute Mbappe doubled Real's advantage with a lethal finish after Vinicius Junior played him through, with Barca complaining again about a perceived foul on Yamal earlier in the move. It was his 26th LaLiga strike, taking him past Barca's Robert Lewandowski on 25 at the top of the scoring charts, and his 38th of the season across all competitions, beating Ivan Zamorano's club record of 37 in a first season with Los Blancos. Just as they have done on so many occasions this season, Flick's spirited young Barca fought their way back in front with a stirring comeback. Thibaut Courtois tipped Gerard Martin's drive over, and from the corner Garcia headed home Ferran Torres' flick-on. Torres flicked wide from close range with an improvised effort and Fede Valverde was booked for a crunching tackle on whirlwind teenager Yamal. Real could not stop the 17-year old star from levelling with a cultured bending effort beyond Courtois after Torres laid the ball off to him in the box. Two minutes later, Raphinha sent Barca ahead, with Pedri threading a pass through for the Brazilian winger to drill home. Raphinha headed over from a brilliant Yamal cross with the outside of his boot, something of a trademark for the Spain international. Mbappe thought he had won another penalty when he fell under pressure from Frenkie de Jong but Video Assistant Referee revealed an offside in the build-up. Moments later, Raphinha netted his second, picking Lucas Vazquez's pocket on the edge of the area, exchanging passes with Torres and beating Courtois. Mbappe netted from an offside position before the break, bringing a rollercoaster first half to a close. Yamal had a goal ruled out for offside early in the second half as Barca looked to put their arch-rivals to the sword. Flick brought on Alejandro Balde and Andreas Christensen, with the latter cutting out a dangerous ball as Vinicius looked for Mbappe. Next time around the Brazilian found his man, with Mbappe slotting home his hat-trick as he and Vinicius broke in behind Barca's high line. Barca appealed for a penalty when Aurelien Tchouameni blocked Torres' shot with his arm, but after watching the incident again the referee decided not to award a penalty. Real substitute Victor Munoz might have levelled late on but fired high and wide when sent through, and Szczesny denied Mbappe, who had another strike ruled out for offside. Barca thought they had wrapped up their win with a superb Fermin Lopez solo effort but it was harshly disallowed for handball against the midfielder. Real had no time left to fight back though, and Barca, who last won the league in 2023, could seal the title as early as Wednesday, should Los Blancos stumble against Mallorca.

Pep Guardiola's men were expected to waltz to three points on England's south coast and pull level with second-placed Arsenal on 67 points. But although they dominated possession, they could not break the deadlock, despite the return to action of Erling Haaland. The point for Southampton takes them to 12 for the season, meaning they have avoided the tag of being the joint-worst team in Premier League history. They are now one point clear of Derby's tally of 11 in the 2007/08 campaign. Despite the draw, third-placed City remain well-placed to finish in the top five, which would secure qualification for the Champions League next season. With two games to play they are four points clear of sixth-placed Nottingham Forest, though their rivals all have a game in hand. City's title defence came off the rails in November and December during a season that Guardiola has admitted has been the toughest of his 16-year managerial career. The away side dominated possession at St Mary's Stadium and had 26 shots but managed just five on target during a frustrating afternoon. Saints had picked up just two points out of a possible 33 in their previous 11 games and were given little chance of getting anything from the match. Brentford beat already relegated Ipswich Town 1-0 for their fourth straight win, climbing to eighth in the table, which may be enough for European football next season. Kevin Schade headed home from Bryan Mbeumo's corner in the 18th minute for his 11th Premier League goal of the season. Brighton, also chasing European football, beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0 at Molineux and are behind Brentford only on goal difference. Danny Welbeck scored a first-half penalty and Brajan Gruda added a second in the 85th minute to secure the three points. Everton went into their match on a poor run of form following a sharp uptick when David Moyes returned to manage the club but they have long reached safety in the top flight. Raul Jimenez put mid-table Fulham ahead at Craven Cottage but Vitalii Mykolenko levelled on the stroke of half-time. Two second-half goals in three minutes from Michael Keane and Beto made it 3-1. Aston Villa travel to Bournemouth in the Saturday evening kick-off, still dreaming of securing a Champions League spot for next season. Fourth-placed Newcastle United host Chelsea, a place below them, Sunday, with Forest in action against relegated Leicester City.

Barca have beaten Real in all three Clasicos played this season, beginning with a 4-0 win in LaLiga at Santiago Bernabeu in October. The Catalans then thrashed Real 5-2 in the Spanish Super Cup final in January and edged them 3-2 in extra-time in the Copa del Rey final in April.

Real were left licking their wounds after a Champions League quarter-final thrashing by Arsenal, and coach Ancelotti is poised to depart at the end of the season, but it could yet be with a major trophy in his hands. Barca's European exit at the hands of Inter Milan Tuesday brightened spirits in the Spanish capital and if Real can overhaul the Catalans at the top of the table, they could transform their season. The nature of Realâs rivalry with Barca means winning LaLiga could either feel great or underwhelming, depending on how their nemesis fares in Europe. With Barca's quadruple dream crushed by Inter, should Real defend their title they could even classify their season as a success. The Catalans, who currently lead by four points with four matches remaining, would be left with only the Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup, both of which they won by beating Real in the final. To do that Real must manage something they have not been able to pull off all season - winning a Clasico. ""We will have a great opportunity, we have to prepare well - it's an almost decisive match,"" said Ancelotti. The teams have faced off three times and Barca triumphed on each occasion, in the two aforementioned finals and in the first league clash at the Santiago Bernabeu in October. Barca netted 12 goals across the four games, conceding four, with Hansi Flick's side outplaying Real on each occasion. However their meeting in Seville in April in the Copa del Rey final was the closest Ancelotti's team have come. Real took the game to extra-time and their Italian coach discovered a set-up which allowed his team to take Barca to the wire. Operating in the second half with Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappe as the forwards, and Rodrygo Goes substituted, Real found the balance they have badly lacked at times this season. ""The last match was competitive, we were very close to winning and I don't think we have to invent a lot of new things (tactically),"" said Ancelotti. ""We have to try and play a serious game, and we will do so with all the confidence in the world. ""Despite all our problems, the fact we are here and we can fight in this match is something beautiful."" Last weekend against Celta Vigo Ancelotti also afforded Turkish 20-year old Arda Guler a rare start and he impressed in midfield, providing impetus which the retired Toni Kroos gave last season, as Real won a LaLiga and Champions League double. Guler also impressed as a substitute in the Copa final and Ancelotti may start him at Olympic Stadium this weekend. ""At Madrid you have to suck it up on the bench before you become an indisputable start in this team - Arda has the profile of a player who could be a starter at Madrid,"" said Ancelotti. ""He sucked it up on the bench, he didn't get annoyed and he has evolved...he's not the same Guler from last September.""",sports

After Hansi Flick's side suffered an agonising extra-time defeat to Inter Milan in the Champions League semi-finals Tuesday, they need to steady themselves quickly to stop their season from crumbling. Barca, who beat Real in the Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup finals, lead Los Blancos by four points at the top of the table with four matches remaining. A home defeat Sunday at Olympic Stadium would not be the death knell for their title bid but would ramp up the pressure on Flick's young, relatively inexperienced charges.

""(This defeat) must wake up the hunger to win the title, this is important for me."" After a slump towards the end of 2024, Barca were re-energised physically and mentally by the winter break. Since January they have blown away virtually every team to cross their path, with a 24-match unbeaten streak. Barca's hunger to win trophies has revealed itself in statistics. The Catalans have completed the most sprints of any team in LaLiga this season and covered the fifth most distance - by contrast, Real have run the least and have the third fewest sprints. However Real have been resting up since their win over Celta Vigo in LaLiga last weekend, while Barca's semi-final defeat over 120 minutes by Inter was drained. ""I don't think this will affect us, it's a tough blow but this team has an incredible mentality and we will go for LaLiga,"" said Barca defender Ronald Araujo. Still recomposing from the Inter defeat, Barca cancelled media commitments ahead of the Clasico. Flick is hoping to bring left-back Alejandro Balde back into the line up after injury, while Robert Lewandowski made his return against Inter too, although he did not appear fully fit.Barca's best player over the two legs against Inter was teenager Lamine Yamal. The 17-year old was a relentless threat on the right flank and even as his team-mates tired, he kept trying to break through. The winger has the most assists in LaLiga with 12 and is the emblem of Flick's exciting young side. Barca have faced Real three times this season and won on each occasion, and although Yamal has only scored two of the 12 goals netted by his side, he has been his side's most dynamic threat against Los Blancos. ""We won't stop until we leave this club where it deserves, on the highest rung,"" he wrote on Instagram after the Champions League defeat. Wrestling back LaLiga from Real would be a good start. ""We're not at the end,"" said Flick, certain his young side, with Yamal, 18-year old Pau Cubarsi and Pedri, 22, at the core, is just beginning to show what they can do. Gavi, 20, is another whose best years lie ahead of him. ""As angry as we are now, we can end this season by winning three trophies...the team that (people said) would not win anything at the start of the season (are having) a very good season despite this setback,"" said Gavi on Instagram. ""Let's get Montjuic rocking Sunday, and win!"" Yamal highlighted Realâs inability to defeat Barca this season after the Copa del Rey final in April. ""This year they can't handle us,"" he said, going on to add more fuel to the fire during his press conference ahead of the first leg of the Inter semi-final. ""While I'm winning, they can't say anything,"" said Yamal. ""When they beat me, they can.""

Arteta's side are destined to finish the season without a major trophy after failing to keep pace with Liverpool and crashing out of the Champions League semi-finals Wednesday. The Gunners' 2-1 defeat against Paris Saint-Germain ended their bid to win the tournament for the first time. It was a painful loss for Arsenal, who created a host of chances in the early stages of the second leg but could not find a way past inspired PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Still licking their wounds from the disappointment in Paris, Arsenal head to Anfield this weekend for the uncomfortable task of watching Liverpool's ongoing title celebrations. Arne Slot's men wrapped up the title two weeks ago, leaving second-placed Arsenal trailing in their wake. After finishing as runners-up to Manchester City for the previous two seasons, the north Londoners remain without a title since 2004. ""Something has to drive you, motivate you, and pain for this is a good one to use, when you really want to do something. It's the right thing to do, usually as a motivation for next season,"" Arteta said of Arsenal's guard of honour for the champions. ""They've been the best team, they've been the most consistent, and what Arne and the coaching staff have done has been fascinating, it's been really good.Â  ""They fully deserve it, and that's the sport. If somebody is better, you have to accept it and try to reach that level."" Arteta attracted criticism in some quarters for claiming Arsenal were the best team in the Champions League this season despite their last four exit. The Spaniard stood by his claim days later, saying: ""100%. I'm watching the impact, I'm watching all the stats because they were the best stats and the best goal difference in the semi-final, so it's very clear.Â  ""When you look at the important stats that normally give you the best platform to win football matches, it's crystal clear who was better."" Arsenal's failure to sign a striker in the January transfer window was a major blow in a season marred by long injury absences for Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka at various stages. ""In January it was clear or not? I made a very clear statement, and the statement continues the same. I want the best team, the best players. If we have three goalscorers over 25, bring them in, we're going to be a much better team, yes,"" Arteta said. Arteta conceded Arsenal have been unable to match his expectations this season. But he is adamant they have the quality to end the club's five-year trophy drought. ""In the Premier League we've done a step backwards. With the points that we have created, it's clear that we haven't done as good as last season, that's obvious,"" he said. ""But with the amount of points that we have generated in the last few seasons, we could have two Premier Leagues.Â  ""So we know how close. We are there, we are providing the numbers that win you titles. We have to be a little bit luckier, but still do better to make sure that nobody has a season better than you.""",sports

If the Hammers beat United and Spurs get a draw or better against Crystal Place, Amorim's men would be an unthinkable 17th in the table, one place above the relegation spots, though they cannot go down.

""They will play because sometimes it's better to play,"" he said. ""What I will protect is the players that can get an injury."" Amorim admitted he had a difficult juggling act, with the Europa League - which gives a Champions League spot to the winner - as a clear priority. ""I think against Brentford (a 4-3 defeat Sunday) we had some mistakes that I felt that some of our players were thinking about this game (against Athletic),"" he said. ""We have to manage that, but we also have to acknowledge that we are Manchester United and we need to win games also in the Premier League. ""We have to use every game to improve, even to prepare for the final, but especially to prepare for the future."" Amorim said criticism of his side from former United captain Roy Keane over the team's Premier League performances was justified. ""We are trying to do our best, but I agree we can do better,"" said the former Sporting Lisbon boss.Â  ""Again, I don't have anything to say about the criticism because we deserve it.Â  ""If we cannot accept everything in this kind of season, I think we are in the wrong business. I fully acknowledge that and I agree with all the critics."" But Amorim, who made eight changes for last weekend's defeat at Brentford, said United had to be smart ahead of the final.

""It's been more demanding - much more. When you don't win it's more demanding emotionally and (in terms of) preparing and the moods and everything. ""It's been more difficult than the previous seasons when we played for the titles."" Injuries, particularly to midfielder Rodri, have been a huge factor in City's decline while a number of individuals have suffered a drop in form. Guardiola does not absolve himself from blame. ""We had a lot of injuries, we didn't have the energy,"" he said. ""We tried most of the time but we were not able to do it. ""I didn't find the way to let them feel comfortable and winning the games."" Guardiola, whose third-placed side travel to relegated Southampton Saturday, admitted City's high standards had slipped. ""But, even with that, I would say, it could be worse. I was not good enough to find a way but we didn't give up,"" he said.

Salah earned the prize after scoring 28 goals and producing 18 assists for Liverpool in the Premier League this season. The Egypt forward broke the record for the most goal involvements in a 38-game Premier League campaign as Arne Slot's side romped to their first title since 2020.

Alonso said it was ""the right moment"" to announce the exit, but did not confirm his next post, saying it was ""not the right moment to talk too much about the future"". Spanish and German media reported Friday the 43-year old has already agreed to join Real and will link up with the Spanish giants after the Club World Cup, replacing Carlo Ancelotti, with a compensation payment of around 12m euros ($13.5m) to be paid to Leverkusen. Taking over in October 2022, Alonso guided Leverkusen to an unbeaten league and cup double in 2023-24, the first Bundesliga title in the club's history.Â  In March 2024, Alonso declared he would stay with the club despite reported interest from Liverpool, Real and Bayern Munich, all of whom he represented as a player.Â  Alonso will be in the home dugout for the final time Sunday against Borussia Dortmund, before his last match as Leverkusen coach away at Mainz.Â  ""We have to enjoy this moment, with mixed emotions. I spoke this morning to the players, the staff, who have been with me during this unbelievable, fantastic three years,"" Alonso said.Â  ""And now itâs the moment to share it Sunday, especially with the fans, in the stadium Sunday, where I lived great emotions and where I have become what I am right now. ""Football is about the moment and I think is a good moment for everyone. Let's enjoy it until the last moment. We can be happy and proud of what we have achieved always with the good feeling we're taking the club in the right direction."" Leverkusen's title defence ended with their 2-2 draw at Freiburg Sunday, which confirmed Bayern as this season's title winners. Alonso's side will finish in second spot regardless of results in their final two matches.Â  Alonso joined in October 2022 with Leverkusen hovering dangerously close to the relegation spots. The Basque immediately put the club back on track; by the end of the season, Leverkusen had risen to fifth, while making the Europa League semi-finals.Â  After bringing in several key pieces in the off-season including midfielder Granit Xhaka, striker Victor Boniface and full-back Alex Grimaldo, Alonso piloted Leverkusen to an unbeaten league and cup double - the first in German football history.Â  In bringing Leverkusen their first league title, Alonso helped shatter the unwanted ""Neverkusen"" moniker given to the club after five second-place finishes, three German Cup final losses and defeat in the 2002 Champions League final. In 2024-25, Leverkusen pushed Bayern until last weekend in the league and remain on track for their second-best points total.Â  Alonso's men were eliminated from the German Cup semi-final by third-tier Arminia Bielefeld and by Bayern in the last 16 of the Champions League.",sports

Ruben Amorim's men, who have endured a terrible Premier League campaign, came into Thursday's second leg at Old Trafford with a comfortable 3-0 cushion. But the 4-1 scoreline gives a misleading impression of the match as the nervy home side struggled to gain a foothold after falling behind to a superb Mikel Jauregizar strike in the first half. A triple substitution shortly after the hour mark changed the game, with substitute Mason Mount scoring two eye-catching goals and Amad Diallo creating havoc on the right. Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored the other goals as the nerves disappeared at Old Trafford, giving way to a raucous party atmosphere. ""I think if you look at both games, it was so much tougher than if you look just to the result,"" said Amorim. ""We have so many weaknesses and you can understand that in the game, but we are fighting and we managed to pass. I think we deserve, if you look at the two games, to be in the final."" In the final, United will face Tottenham, who beat Norwegian champions Bodo/Glimt 5-1 on aggregate. Amorim, who replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag in November, admitted the showpiece in Bilbao later this month would be his biggest match so far at the club. ""The money (in the Champions League) is not the most important, even the title,"" he said. ""To win a title as a coach is that feeling. It's that feeling that we can do good things, the feeling to give something to our fans, especially in this kind of season."" United are heading for their worst finish in the English top-flight since they were relegated in 1974, though they cannot go down this season. But it has been a radically different story in Europe, where they are the only team unbeaten in the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League. The fact that United are pinning all their hopes on Europe's second-tier club competition is a sign of how far they have fallen since they were regularly competing at the sharp end of the Champions League. They reached four Champions League finals under former manager Sir Alex Ferguson, winning two of them. Ex-Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, now FIFA's head of global football development, believes it is not appropriate that the Europa League winners qualify for the Champions League. This is especially because five English teams will qualify for Europe's top club competition through the Premier League. Rival teams will balk at the presence of United or Tottenham in next season's Champions League after their dire league form. Both teams are guaranteed to finish outside of the European qualification places in the Premier League, with United currently in 15th and Spurs in 16th. But the rules are set and both clubs have the chance to finish on a high. Tottenham have beaten United three times this season, twice in the Premier League and once in the League Cup, but Amorim is not unduly perturbed. ""Every game has its history. So, we lost the three last games, we can win this one,"" said the former Sporting Lisbon boss. ""So, if you look at the odds, we are closer to win than to lose. Both teams are going to play like all or nothing in this kind of game. It's quite similar. The position of the coach is quite similar.Â  ""I know that (Spurs manager) Ange (Postecoglou) has been there for one more year. It is different, the context, but we are struggling, both of us.

If PSG in past years under their Qatari owners have consistently stumbled on big occasions, the Spaniard's thrilling side has taken Europe by storm this season. The 2-1 win over Arsenal at a rocking Parc des Princes Wednesday, secured thanks to goals by Fabian Ruiz and Achraf Hakimi, clinched a 3-1 aggregate semi-final triumph and set up a meeting with Inter Milan in the final in Munich on May 31. PSG, the perennial French champions, have defeated four clubs from the mighty Premier League on this run, their victory against the Gunners following wins over Manchester City, Liverpool and Aston Villa since January. They have done it with a youthful side in which six starters against Arsenal were 24 or under, and the oldest player is captain Marquinhos, at 30 - compare that to Inter who had two 36-year olds and one 37-year old playing against Barcelona a day earlier. Wednesday's win sparked wild celebrations around the French capital, with fans partying on the Champs-Elysees in scenes unimaginable late last year, although the party descended into sporadic violence as the night wore on. PSG lost three of their first five Champions League games this season and appeared in real danger of early elimination. That was off the back of the departure of Kylian Mbappe, their all-time top scorer, following last season's semi-final exit to Borussia Dortmund. Mbappe must have thought he had a better chance of winning the Champions League with Real Madrid and at that point PSG seemed further away than ever from getting their hands on the prize. But Enrique, appointed in 2023 just as Lionel Messi and Neymar left the club, has completely transformed the side, and PSG have hit new heights in the second half. ""The coach has gone step by step. He arrived and he saw a lot of things needed to be improved,"" defender Marquinhos told Canal Plus. ""The DNA needed changing, a mentality needed to be put in place, and it wasn't going to be done overnight."" Where once they had three superstar forwards who did not defend, now PSG play a voracious pressing game, defending from the front to suffocate opponents. ""The coach says it is very difficult to be an attacking player in his team because you need to put in a lot of effort,"" Marquinhos added. ""When you play in a collective manner like that you get so much confidence, so it comes down to hard work as well as the quality of the players."" PSG have gone from being almost a laughing stock, to now being the envy of the continent. ""It makes us think about all we have experienced, all the scars. Some guys have just arrived, maybe they don't know how difficult it is to get this far,"" said Marquinhos, at PSG since 2013. This transformation has not been done on the cheap, with PSG still spending upwards of 600m euros ($677m) in the last two years. But the money has been spent impressively, including on the January signing of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia from Napoli, making PSG serious contenders. ""Everyone wants to win the Champions League, all 36 teams, but only a very small number can do so,"" said Enrique, who won the competition with Barca a decade ago. ""Our objective is to make history and we still have one more step to go."" This season's final will be the first to feature no club from Spain, England or Germany since 2004, when Porto defeated Monaco in Gelsenkirchen - a club representing France losing a Champions League final in Germany, which is exactly what PSG are hoping to avoid. This is PSG's second final, after their loss to Bayern Munich behind closed doors during the Covid pandemic in Lisbon in 2020. Now they go to Munich, where Marseille won France's only Champions League so far, against Inter's rivals AC Milan in 1993. Could that be a sign? ""Let's not forget it is their second final in three years which shows they are an established team,"" Enrique said of Inter, three-time European Cup winners. ""They obviously have more experience, not only with the players they have but also as a club. ""But we have dreamt since we came here of having the opportunity to play these finals and win trophies.""",sports

Fireworks crackled and red smoke filled an expectant Old Trafford following an impressive 3-0 win against 10-man Athletic in northern Spain last week. But the air of excitement was tinged by the knowledge that Ruben Amorim's United have shown a startling ability to implode during a horrendous Premier League season. Amorim reverted to the team that started in the first leg, making eight changes following Sunday's 4-3 defeat against Brentford. Dani Vivian was suspended after his red card last week and coach Ernesto Valverde was also hamstrung by the absence of brothers Nico and Inaki Williams as well as top-scorer Oihan Sancet. Mikel Jauregizar silenced the home fans and gave the visitors hope on the night with a stunning strike in the 31st minute. For long periods of the match the visitors looked more dangerous but substitute Mason Mount settled the home supporters' nerves with 18 minutes to go. The match totally changed complexion as Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund and Mount again scored. It means United have kept alive their hopes of eking something out of a terrible season. Winning Europe's second-tier club trophy crucially guarantees a place in the Champions League, which would boost United's chances of attracting top talent as Amorim attempts a monumental rebuild. United were heavy favourites to complete the job on home turf but injury-hit Athletic nursed a grievance after defender Vivian was sent off in Spain. They enjoyed the bulk of the early possession but struggled to fashion clear-cut chances and looked nervous when the visitors attacked. Athletic midfielder Alex Berenguer had a good early opportunity after the home side failed to clear but his curling shot sailed over the bar as he aimed for the top corner. The midfielder created another chance after a surging run midway through the half but fired wide of Andre Onana's post from just outside the area. But the visitors broke the deadlock in sensational style after half an hour to give themselves hope when Jauregizar picked his spot from outside the box and curled past Onana. The goal came after some sloppy work from United's defence. Harry Maguire played a ball across the box and Alvaro Djalo smashed a shot against Leny Yoro. The ball fell to Jauregizar, who could not have hit the ball more sweetly. United struggled for attacking rhythm but should have been level shortly before half-time. The stadium held its breath as Alejandro Garnacho was put through by the lively Patrick Dorgu but his attempted dink over the goalkeeper went wide. United offered little going forward in the early stages of the second half as Athletic made the running, forcing United to hack clear on multiple occasions. Both teams made a triple change just after the hour mark. Shortly afterwards Unai Gomez headed the ball across the goal and it bounced just wide of the post. Injury-hit Mount has been a peripheral figure in his two seasons at Old Trafford but produced a fine finish, swivelling and curling the ball into the far corner in the 72nd minute. Casemiro scored a second with his head from a Bruno Fernandes cross as United's earlier nerves were completely forgotten. Hojlund poked home in the 85th minute before Mount scored an outrageous second from near the halfway line after Athletic goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala came out of his box and made a poor clearance. United will face Tottenham in the final in Bilbao on May 21.

But the 23-year old Pole dropped just a single game in winning 6-1, 6-0 against Italian Cocciaretto to move onto a third-round meeting with American Danielle Collins. ""I felt like the ball was kind of listening to me and I had full control over the match, so it's always pretty comfortable to play a match like that,"" Swiatek said.

The Asian side will travel to Sri Lanka for a multi-format series that commences next month, with the two-match Test series the highlight as the teams start the next World Test Championship cycle. While Taskin has been battling an Achilles tendon injury and missed Bangladesh's recent two-match Test series at home against Zimbabwe, there is internal optimism that the right-armer will be fit to return to action and feature against Sri Lanka. Taskin recently met with specialists in London to determine the next step in his recovery and the 30-year old was advised he would not need surgery to fix his troublesome area. While Bangladesh's upcoming white-ball series against United Arab Emirates and Pakistan has been deemed too soon for Taskin, it is hoped he will be fit to return in time to take on Sri Lanka with the first Test between the two teams taking place from June 17 in Galle. ""The specialists believe that a conservative, non-surgical approach is the best course of action for Taskin at this time,"" Bangladesh senior physician Debashish Chowdhury said via a statement. ""The rehabilitation programme is tailored to gradually restore his fitness and manage the tendon condition effectively. We are optimistic about his progress.""

Miraz gains one place to move to second overall on the latest rankings for Test all-rounders on the back of his heroics for Bangladesh in their recent Test series against Zimbabwe, with Jadeja's lead at the top now under 100 rating points. The in-form Miraz scored 116 runs and claimed 15 wickets across the two Tests and was rewarded on the updated International Cricket Councilâs Men's Test Player Rankings by improving to a new career-best rating of 327 points and within 73 rating points of No.1 ranked Jadeja. Miraz was instrumental in Bangladesh's triumph in the second Test against Zimbabwe in Chittagong, with the 27-year old scoring a vital century for his side when coming into bat at No.7 and then bowling his side to victory with a five-wicket haul on the third and final day of the match. His efforts also saw improvements come in other individual categories, with Miraz improving eight places to 55th on the list for Test batters following his second Test century.

Dusting themselves down from their painful elimination at the hands of Inter Milan Tuesday, Barca will take pride in knowing the club are closer than ever to ending the decade-long drought in the continent's premier competition. Barca lost 4-3 in extra-time in Milan, with the Italians progressing 7-6 on aggregate after a thrilling rollercoaster of a match in which they threw away a 2-0 lead. For the first time since 2019 the Catalans made the final four, but they were dreaming of more - a first Champions League trophy since 2015 and a potential quadruple. ""The players deserve respect, but we are playing to win trophies,"" said Flick, not content with merely restoring Barca's status among the elite. With the wizardry of Lamine Yamal, the goals of Raphinha and brains of Pedri, pulling strings in midfield, Barca have enough to end their wait for the trophy in the post-Lionel Messi era. An inspired Yann Sommer, a shaky Barca defence missing injured regulars Jules Kounde and Alejandro Balde, and Inter's experience ensured they did not. ""Of course (something special) has started, but we're not at the end - we had a really huge defeat now,"" said Flick. ""We're not satisfied about that but it's normal. We have to stand up, this is the message I want to give. ""We have to fight until the end of the season - and for next season."" Barca were two minutes away from booking their flights to Munich, leading 3-2 on the night at the San Siro in the pouring rain, but Francesco Acerbi's 93rd minute strike forced extra-time before Davide Frattesi won it for the hosts. Arguably the best player in both legs of the tie was 17-year old Spain star Yamal, but he showed his inexperience in stoppage time before Acerbi struck. Rampaging down the right, yet again, Yamal crashed a shot against the post when he might have headed for the corner flag. In the first-half 18-year old Pau Cubarsi, another graduate of Barca's La Masia academy, conceded a penalty with a risky challenge on Lautaro Martinez. ""We have a young team and we will improve of course,"" Flick told reporters. ""This is our job, to make this team better and better."" Despite the mistakes they made, Barca's elimination was a far cry from the humiliations they have suffered in recent years - against Roma, Liverpool and Bayern most notably between 2018-2020, or dropping into the Europa League after that. ""We've given everything, this year it wasn't to be, but we'll be back, don't have any doubt,"" Yamal wrote on Instagram. ""We won't stop until we leave this club where it deserves, on the highest rung. ""I will fulfil my promise and bring (the Champions League) to Barcelona, we won't stop until we get it."" Flick's side must pick themselves up quickly because Sunday they face arch-rivals Real Madrid in a clash which could go a long way to deciding the fate of LaLiga. The Catalans lead the reigning champions by four points with four matches remaining and want to add the league title to their Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup triumphs. Real are fresh after their win over Celta last Sunday, while Barca played 120 draining minutes against Inter and leave Italy with the hearts broken. ""I think the team, when they look in the mirror, when they arrive at home at three or four o'clock in the night, or in the morning, I think then they can be very proud,"" said Flick. ""(This defeat) must wake up the hunger to win the title, this is important for me."" Barca's players did their best to put on a brave face. ""We've gone beyond expectations, we're Barca, there are no transition years, we have to win all the trophies we can,"" Eric Garcia told Movistar. ""We couldn't do it, but the team comes out strengthened."" Realâs impending visit to Olympic Stadium will be a quick test of that.",sports

The 30-year old playmaker has been a key figure at Old Trafford since joining from Sporting Lisbon in 2020 and scored two goals in last week's 3-0 Europa League semi-final first-leg win at Athletic Bilbao. But the build-up to Thursday's return fixture in Manchester has been dominated by talk that Saudi club Al-Hilal are poised to make a big-money offer for Fernandes. But Amorim, who said in March he told Fernandes he was ""not going anywhere"" following links to Real Madrid, was similarly defiant amid talk of a post-season move to Saudi Arabia. ""I think it is easy to understand (his importance) - not just because of the numbers but the way he plays, the importance that he has during his five years here,"" United head coach Amorim told a pre-match press conference Wednesday. ""He is a top player, we need top players. He is a leader, he's the captain, so he's really important. It's normal that a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno, like (Alejandro) Garnacho, like others. ""But we want to keep the best players and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world, so our idea didn't change. We want Bruno here."" Garnacho, meanwhile, says he is happy at Old Trafford as speculation intensifies over his future. The 20-year old United academy product has scored 26 goals in 140 appearances for the Red Devils, including during last May's FA Cup final win over local rivals Manchester City. But Garnacho's future is uncertain as United look to rebuild amid profit and sustainability restrictions, with Chelsea and Napoli expressing interest during the winter transfer window. ""Obviously as a footballer you are always going to read and listen to some rumours about the future,"" Argentina international Garnacho, speaking alongside Amorim, said Wednesday.Â  ""But I have a contract here until 2028, so I'm happy here."" United are well-placed in their last chance to win a trophy at the end of a disappointing season where the fallen kings of English football are currently a lowly 15th in the Premier League table after Portuguese boss Amorim replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag in November. Not only are they 3-0 up after the first leg in Spain, with Fernandes' double following Casemiro's opening goal, but Athletic also had Dani Vivian sent off. United's Matthijs de Ligt, however, looks set to miss the second leg after sitting out training on the eve of Thursday's semi-final. The Netherlands international returned from a month out as a second-half substitute in Spain and went on to start in Sunday's 4-3 loss away to Brentford, only to limp off after 35 minutes. Christian Eriksen also missed Wednesday's training session but is expected to be available Thursday.",sports

United are currently a lowly 15th in the 20-team table - and only scraped through to the last four of the Europa League after a remarkable comeback against Lyon. But they now have one foot in the final after a 3-0 semi-final first leg win against Athletic Bilbao last week ahead of Thursday's return encounter at Old Trafford. An all-English final is in prospect should Tottenham Hotspur defeat Bodo/Glimt, giving the sides 15th and 16th in the Premier League at present a chance to win a continental trophy, with the considerable added bonus of qualifying for the Champions League. ""In the end of this season, we can be the worst (United) team in Premier League history with a European title, so it will change nothing,"" Amorim told reporters Wednesday. ""We know that this season was really disappointing for everybody. Nothing is going to change,"" added United manager Amorim, who took charge of the fallen English giants after replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag in November. United may be well-placed but Amorim believes they must guard against their tendency to ""lose our mind a little bit"" if they are to reach a final that will be played at Bilbao's San Mames ground on May 21. Casemiro's header and two goals from skipper Bruno Fernandes in Bilbao put them in a strong position in Spain, with the hosts reduced to 10 men following Dani Vivian's red card. All 133 teams in the competition's history to have scored three or more goals away from home in the first leg have gone through. But Amorim is taking nothing for granted and believes United must score at least one more goal to book their place in the final.Â  ""If you look at our season, anything is possible, so we have to understand one goal can change anything, the momentum of the game,"" he said.Â  ""One sending off, you saw it a week ago, so we are prepared to fight to win the game not thinking about the result. ""Of course that matters and the way we are going to do things, especially when we start the game, but of course we are thinking about winning the game."" Athletic face a tough task, but United have lost 3-0 at Old Trafford three times so far this season and were beaten 4-3 at Brentford last weekend. ""I feel that we need to score to go to the next round, so that is clearly the way we are going to face the game,"" Amorim said. Athletic boss Ernesto Valverde insisted his side still have a chance of a stunning victory despite the absence of four key players. Vivian is suspended after his first leg red card, while Nico and Inaki Williams have been ruled out through injury, along with top scorer Oihan Sancet.Â  ""There's no point thinking about the ones who aren't here. We know we've got some key injuries, but it's about the ones who are on the field,"" Valverde said. ""They're the ones who will be trying to turn this tie around. It's not going to be easy. We also know how high quality our opponents are and their stadium, but this is football. Anything can happen.Â  ""That's what we always hope for, and we're hoping for the best like we always do.""",sports

Postecoglou's troubled side can seal a place in the Europa League final when they face Bodo/Glimt in the semi-final second leg in Norway Thursday. Tottenham won the first leg 3-1 as they look to set up a final showdown with Athletic Bilbao or Manchester United, who go into their second leg with a 3-0 advantage. Despite languishing in 16th place in the Premier League, Europa League glory would earn them qualification for the Champions League due to a UEFA rule in place since the 2014-15 campaign. United are one place above Tottenham in the English top-flight after an equally bad domestic campaign. And former Arsenal boss Wenger, currently head of global football development at FIFA, this week told beIN Sport that Tottenham and United should not be able to get into Europe's elite competition via the Europa League, urging UEFA to ""review"" their rule. The under-fire Postecoglou responded to Wenger's controversial comments in acerbic fashion. ""Well, I mean that's a debate that's been raging for years, like at least the last eight days,"" Postecoglou told reporters Wednesday. ""I've never heard that before. I've said it before, mate, Spurs does crazy things to people. It does, it does. ""You put that club into any sentence or any issue and invariably they all come out and try and diminish as much as they can."" Although Tottenham's troubled season hardly warrants a place in the Champions League, Postecoglou said victory in the Europa League would make it a worthy achievement. The Australian cannot understand why Wenger raised the topic now, insisting the rules should be respected. ""Why wasn't there an issue before and it's an issue now? What's the difference? I don't understand what the difference is,"" he said. ""Last year, fifth didn't get you into the Champions League, this year it does. What does that mean? ""There are competition rules and the rules say the winner goes into Champions League and it's not the first year. ""And there isn't an asterisk against it that you have to do something else as well, but it's Spurs, mate, they love it. They love it. ""I've got a great respect for Arsene. He's one of the legends of the game, but it does crazy things to people, mate. I love it, bring it on. It's going to upset people, so that makes me happy."" Asked if Tottenham had made him crazy as well during a season where he has faced constant speculation over his future, Postecoglou said: ""It hasn't made me crazy at all.

""Over the two legs we scored more goals than them and in football it's the most important thing, but Arsenal played a great game and we suffered a lot,"" the Spaniard said after PSG's 2-1 win in the second leg in Paris secured a 3-1 aggregate triumph. Goals either side of half-time by Fabian Ruiz and Achraf Hakimi put the French champions out of sight in the tie before Bukayo Saka pulled one back for Arsenal, while PSG's Vitinha had a penalty saved. However, the hosts needed goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to make several vital saves and Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta claimed his team had been better over the two legs.

PSG will now face Inter Milan in the final in Munich on May 31 after an extraordinary run in the competition which has also seen them knock out two other Premier League sides in Liverpool and Aston Villa. It comes after they had been in real danger of elimination due to a poor run of results in the league phase - they lost three of their first five matches, including a 2-0 defeat against Arsenal. That meant they came 15th out of 36 teams and finished eight points behind the best team, Liverpool.

Arteta's side crashed to a 3-1 aggregate defeat after losing 2-1 in the second leg at Parc des Princes. It was a painful loss for the Gunners, who created numerous chances in the early stages, only to be denied by a series of superb saves from Gianluigi Donnarumma. Goals from Fabian Ruiz and Achraf Hakimi put PSG in control and although Bukayo Saka reduced the deficit, it was too late to spark a sensational fightback.Â  PSG will meet Inter Milan in the final, while Arsenal face up to a trophy drought that has now extended to five years. Arteta responded to the loss in combative fashion, claiming Arsenal were as good as PSG and were unlucky not to have beaten the French champions. ""When you look at the two games their best player on the pitch has been the goalkeeper, he has been the difference for them in the tie,"" Arteta said. ""I'm very proud of the players. 100% I don't think there's been a better team in the competition from what I have seen, but we are out.Â  ""We were very close, much closer than the result showed but unfortunately we are out. ""After 20 minutes it should have been 3-0. We were very close and for long periods of both games we were much better than them but we are not in the final and that has to hurt."" Not for the first time this season, Arsenal paid the price for a lack of cutting edge and untimely defensive mistakes. And even Arteta had to concede the north Londoners were punished for their failings in both penalty areas. ""If we want to win this competition we have to realise that. There are certain things that are on us. You shouldn't just be understanding we are out. That is not the way I look at it,"" he said. ""This competition is about the boxes and in both boxes are the strikers and the goalkeepers and theirs was the best in both games."" Having failed in the bid to win the Champions League for the first time, the Gunners are still waiting for their first silverware since the 2020 FA Cup. Injuries to key players played a major role in their failure to push Liverpool in the Premier League title race. And Arteta insisted his wounded side's gallant display against PSG - who had already knocked Liverpool and Aston Villa out of the Champions League this season - gave him hope for the future. ""The players deserve a lot of credit for what they are doing in the context of the situation and the amount of injuries, probably the worst state you could arrive here as a team,"" he said. ""You have to arrive in the competition at this stage with a full squad in the best condition, and we haven't got that. ""To come here with a different context and still do that, it gives me a lot of positives for the future but I am very upset, so annoyed that we didn't manage to do it."" While Arteta saluted his players' efforts, he struck a more equivocal tone when asked if Arsenal have the quality to eventually succeed in their quest to land a major prize. ""It depends.

Chasing 180 for victory, Chennai slipped to 60/5 in the sixth over before Brevis hit 52 and impact substitute Shivam Dube made 45 to steer the team home with two balls to spare at Kolkata's Eden Gardens. Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit a six when Chennai needed eight off the last over and finished unbeaten on 17 with No 10 Anshul Kamboj hitting the winning four off Andre Russell. The result left Kolkata's chances of making the playoffs hanging by a thread as they need to win the remaining two matches and hope other results go their way. ""It was really tough,"" Kolkata skipper Ajinkya Rahane said of the defeat. ""We were 10-15 short, 185-195 would have been an ideal total. The bowlers bowled really well but tough to be on the losing side. On the way forward, Rahane said, ""Pretty simple. Try to win two out of two, and then see what happens from there."" Five-time champions Chennai had already bowed out of the playoff race. Afghanistan spinner Noor Ahmad set up victory with his four wickets that kept Kolkata down to 179/6. In reply, Chennai openers Ayush Mhatre and Devon Conway both fell for ducks but IPL debutant Urvil Patel clobbered the Kolkata attack in his 11-ball 31. Spinner Varun Chakravarthy bowled Ravindra Jadeja but Brevis and Dube put the chase back on track in their carefully crafted stand. Brevis took his time to get going before he blasted 30 runs off Vaibhav Arora, reaching his fifty with three sixes and three fours in one over. Chakravarthy soon cut short Brevis' blitz, but the left-handed Dube then found Dhoni for company. Arora dismissed Dube as Rinku Singh clung on to a steepling catch before taking another opportunity to dismiss Noor, but Dhoni and Kamboj got the team through to just their third win in 12 matches. The 43-year old Dhoni still remained the biggest draw for the Kolkata crowd and the former India captain who played down talk of imminent retirement, saying he would entertain his fans as long as he can. ""A lot of them don't know when it is going to be my last time, so they want to come and see me play,"" said Dhoni. ""After this IPL is over, I have to work hard for another six to eight months to see if my body can take this pressure. (There's) Nothing to decide now but the love and affection I have seen is excellent."" Earlier Kolkata lost opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz early on 11 before Sunil Narine (26) and Rahane, who made 48, put on 58 runs to rebuild the innings. Noor broke the stand with left-arm wrist spin to get Narine stumped by Dhoni and three balls later had Angkrish Raghuvanshi caught behind for one. Rahane was joined by Manish Pandey but was denied his fifty by Jadeja's left-arm spin, spooning a reverse sweep to backward point. Pandey stood firm and combined to add 46 with Russell, who hammered 38 off 21 balls before Noor struck again to have the big-hitter caught at long-off. Player of the match Noor removed Rinku for nine and despite Manish's presence Kolkata's total ultimately proved insufficient. Noor moved to 20 wickets in 12 matches alongside this season's leading bowler Prasidh Krishna - Gujarat Titans pace bowler who also has 20 scalps but in 11 matches.Â  57TH MATCH Kolkata Knight Riders 179/6 (Rahane 48, Noor 4/31) lost to Chennai Super Kings 183/8 in 19.4 overs (Brevis 52, Dube 45) by 2 wickets",sports

In 67 Tests, Rohit scored 4,301 runs including 12 centuries with a best of 212 against South Africa in 2019 and an average of over 40. He captained India in 24 Tests with 12 wins, nine defeats and three draws. ""Hello everyone I would just like to share that I am retiring from Test cricket,"" the 38-year old Rohit wrote on Instagram. ""It's been an absolute honour to represent my country in whites. Thank you for all the love and support over the years. I will continue to represent India in the ODI format."" Rohit, who quit Twenty20 internationals along with Virat Kohli after India's T20 World Cup triumph in Barbados last year, recently led the team to an One Day International Champions Trophy title in Dubai. India will begin a five-Test series in England in June-July and the team now need a new Test skipper. India's cricket board said, ""Rohit Sharma has informed us of his decision to retire from Test cricket. A legend of the red-ball game."" ""We will soon announce a new Test captain - it's time for the next generation to rise."" Rohit's last Test was in Melbourne last year when India lost to Australia by 184 runs. He stood down as captain in the fifth Test in Sydney due to poor batting form but India went on to lose the match and the five-match series 2-1. Jasprit Bumrah was Rohit's deputy in Australia and led the team in the first Test, which Rohit missed due to the birth of his second child, and the final Test. Rohit managed just 31 runs in five innings of his three outings Down Under and the Indian media speculated that he could retire from Test cricket after the series. The captain, nicknamed âHitmanâ for getting to big scores quickly - especially in white-ball, also had a poor home series against Bangladesh and New Zealand late last year. Rohit's India won both the Tests against Bangladesh, but New Zealand handed a rare 3-0 whitewash to the hosts. Rohit began his Test career in 2013, but it was five years later that he came into his own in the five-day format as a swashbuckling opener and later took over as captain from Kohli. ""As player and as captain, you were a joy and India will say a big thank you to you,"" veteran commentator Harsha Bhogle posted on social media. ""That century in Chennai, that one at the Oval, both priceless. You walked out against South Africa to open as if you had done it all your life. Will look forward to watching and, hopefully calling, some more great moments in your ODI career."" After India's defeat in Australia, the Board of Control for Cricket in India mandated national players to participate in the domestic Ranji Trophy, forcing Rohit and Kohli to take field. Rohit's batting woes continued as he made three and 28 against Jammu and Kashmir, but he was retained as captain of the ODI team. Rohit is currently playing the Indian Premier League T20 tournament with Mumbai Indians and has endured a patchy season so far, scoring 300 runs in 11 matches.",sports

Ruiz crashed in a shot from the edge of the area in the 27th minute at Parc des Princes after PSG had withstood an early bombardment from the visitors. Already leading in the tie after Ousmane Dembele's goal in last week's first leg, PSG then saw Vitinha have a second-half penalty saved. However, Hakimi put the tie beyond Arsenal when he scored in the 72nd minute, even if Bukayo Saka did then pull one back for the visitors. PSG's triumph sparked wild celebrations in the stadium and around the French capital, including on the Champs-Elysees, as they advance to a showdown in Munich on May 31 against Inter Milan. It will be the second Champions League final in their history, five years after a defeat by Bayern Munich in Lisbon. ""We have worked hard as a club to get this and to deserve it. It has been a long, hard road,"" PSG captain Marquinhos told broadcaster Canal Plus. ""The job is done in terms of getting to the final but it's not finished, we want more. We really want to win the trophy."" Â  Arsenal, meanwhile, saw their European dream come to an end as they fell short of reaching what would have been their second final, 19 years after losing to Barcelona in Paris. Still without a trophy since the 2020 FA Cup, all that is left to play for now for Mikel Arteta's side is securing a third consecutive second-place finish in the Premier League. ""To do what we have done in Paris against this team is remarkable, but the fact is that we are out,"" admitted Arteta. ""Sometimes you have to applaud the opposition, and what the 'keeper did in both games. He won the game for them,"" he added of PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma. There was an electric atmosphere all evening in Paris, and PSG were able to celebrate getting to a final in front of their fans for the first time, after the victory against RB Leipzig in the last four in 2020 was played behind closed doors during the pandemic. There was a feverish mood in and around the ground pre-match, but PSG have tripped up in big Champions League ties plenty of times over the last decade. In addition, their top scorer Dembele was not in the starting line-up having come off with a hamstring problem in the first leg. Arsenal, with Thomas Partey back in midfield after suspension, did their best to silence the raucous home support by throwing everything at the Parisians right from the off. Declan Rice headed just wide, and Donnarumma denied Gabriel Martinelli before producing a stunning save to keep out a Martin Odegaard shot, all inside the opening eight minutes. PSG did eventually settle, and they almost went ahead on 17 minutes when Desire Doue teed up Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, whose curling shot hit the far post. Then Doue wasted a great chance but PSG did score before the half-hour mark. A Vitinha free-kick was headed out by Partey but fell to Ruiz on the edge of the box, and he controlled before smashing in a left-foot shot as the ball bounced back up. It was the ideal moment for the 29-year old Spaniard to score his first Champions League goal. Barcola failed to convert a good chance for the hosts to score again moments later, and Arsenal still had some hope going into the second half. Only another stunning Donnarumma save with his fingertips prevented Saka from pulling one back on 64 minutes, before PSG were awarded a spot-kick. German referee Felix Zwayer gave the penalty after being summoned to the pitchside monitor when a shot by Hakimi brushed the hand of Myles Lewis-Skelly. Arteta was furious at the decision, yet Vitinha's kick was turned away by David Raya diving to his left. Nevertheless, PSG made it 2-0 on the night when Dembele, on from the bench, teed up Hakimi to finish in style. This being PSG, however, there was a wobble as Saka quickly pulled one back from close range after Leandro Trossard had got the better of Marquinhos on the wing. Saka then somehow blazed over with an open goal gaping from Riccardo Calafiori's cross, ensuring that there would be no miracle Arsenal comeback and it would be PSG's night.

""We're here to win the game. We're here to make a statement. We want to get to the final. So we need to be ready to go and do that,"" Rice told reporters at Parc des Princes on the eve of Wednesday's showdown. ""We need to have big balls and we need to go out there on the biggest stage and show that we're ready to play at this level. ""It's going to be the biggest night in this club's history if we can get to the final. So we're fully ready to go."" PSG hold the advantage coming into Wednesday's match after Ousmane Dembele's early goal gave them a narrow victory at Emirates Stadium a week ago. However, both Rice and Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta said they believed they could get the better of a side who have eliminated Premier League opposition in each of the last two rounds, knocking out Liverpool in the last 16 and Aston Villa in the quarter-finals. ""I think you need to have full belief,"" Rice said. ""We certainly have that as a group. I think if we are the best versions of ourselves tomorrow night - and we know we can be that - there is no stopping us getting into that final."" The England star said Arsenal could lean on the experience of facing reigning European champions Real Madrid in Spain in the last round, when Arteta's team won 2-1 to progress 5-1 on aggregate. ""When we went to the Bernabeu the other week there were a lot of questions about whether we could rise to that occasion,"" said Rice, who scored two wonderful free-kicks in the first leg of that tie. ""We obviously had a 3-0 lead but there was still so much talk about them coming back and playing at the Bernabeu and we had not experienced that before. ""But I think as a group we handled that amazingly well. We have proved that we can handle big situations and tomorrow night is another massive step for this team."" Arsenal have to win on the night if they are to make it to Munich later this month for the Champions League final for the second time in the club's history. That means someone will need to step up and make themselves a hero, just as Rice did against Real in the last round. ""In that game against Real Madrid, obviously I was able to produce two free-kicks which were incredible, but tomorrow night is set up for someone else to maybe get that magic moment. ""Hopefully we can deliver something special."" Arteta, who used to play for PSG, said his side did not deserve to lose in the first leg and called on them to rise to the occasion once again by securing the Gunners' first appearance in the final of Europe's elite club competition since 2006. ""We are a win away from being in the Champions League final, in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, against a great opponent. It doesn't get much better than that,"" he said. ""We are here to make history."" Arteta said Dutch defender Jurrien Timber's fitness would be assessed Tuesday evening before a decision would be taken on whether he could feature. However, Riccardo Calafiori travelled with the squad to Paris and is fit - the Italian has not played since the last 16, second leg against PSV Eindhoven on March 12. Earlier, PSG coach Luis Enrique declared first-leg match-winner Dembele fit to play despite coming off with a hamstring issue in London last week.",sports

Gujarat started strongly in their initial chase of 156 with a second-wicket stand of 72 between skipper Shubman Gill, who fell to an inspired Jasprit Bumrah after a rain break, and Jos Buttler at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium. Bad weather interrupted play twice and after the second delay the victory target was revised to 147 from 19 overs, leaving Gujarat needing 15 from the final six balls. Rahul Tewatia began with a four off Deepak Chahar and Gerald Coetzee smashed a six on the third ball before holing out on the fifth with only one run required to win. But No 9 Arshad Khan stole a single off the final ball after hitting it to Pandya at mid-off, as the former Gujarat skipper, now Mumbai captain, missed the wicket with his throw from close range. Gujarat jumped to the top of the 10-team table and pushed Mumbai, whose winning streak of six matches came to an end, to fourth. The top four teams after the league phase will make the playoffs, with the final on May 25 in Kolkata. Gujarat were cruising at 113/2 after the first rain break when Bumrah, who returned figure of 2/19, bowled Gill for a 46-ball 43 and fellow quick Trent Boult trapped impact substitute Sherfane Rutherford leg before wicket for 28. Bumrah rattled the stumps of the big-hitting Shahrukh Khan and Gujarat slipped to 126/6 when Rashid Khan was out for two.

Mumbai were restricted to 155/8 despite Will Jacks' 53 and a late cameo of 27 by Corbin Bosch. Pace spearhead Mohammed Siraj claimed a wicket from just the second ball when he got Mumbai's South African opener Ryan Rickelton caught out for two. Gujarat's fielders then dropped three catches, including two reprieves to Jacks who counter-attacked after the fall of Rohit Sharma, for seven. England batter Jacks, along with Suryakumar Yadav, who made 35, put on 71 runs for the third wicket. Sai Kishore broke the stand with his left-arm spin to cut short Suryakumar's 24-ball knock and trigger a collapse.

Italy midfielder Frattesi won a tie for the ages under a downpour in Milan when he lashed home in the 99th minute after great play from Marcus Thuram, sending a packed and rocking San Siro wild with joy. Simone Inzaghi's team will face either Arsenal or Paris Saint-Germain at the end of this month in Munich, where they will feel they have a great chance to be crowned kings of Europe for a fourth time after coming out on top in an epic contest. Frattesi has become something of a super-sub for Inter and he struck late just as he did in the first leg of his team's quarter-final win over Bayern Munich. ""It's just incredible, I don't know what to say. I thought after the Bayern game I couldn't ever feel the same emotions, but tonight was even more incredible,"" said Frattesi to Sky Sport. âThis has been my career, really. I wasn't blessed with incredible talent, but I never give up and always believe and this is the reward for all my effort and dedication."" Tuesday's triumph saved Inter's season as their bid for the treble went up in smoke after getting past Bayern. Inter conceded top spot in Serie A to Napoli, who are favourites to claim the domestic league title, while AC Milan dumped them out of the Italian Cup. But Inter ended Barca's hopes for the quadruple and head into the final weeks of the season buoyant with a second Champions League final in three seasons to look forward to. ""We know that there are two really strong teams in the other semi. But you have to play to win any final,"" said Federico Dimarco. Barca now have to try to maintain their four-point lead over Real Madrid at the top of LaLiga Sunday after missing out on a chance to claim every trophy available this season. ""The truth is we are sad. We wanted to get to the final, we were having a great Champions League campaign,"" said Ronald Araujo to Movistar. ""We were very close and it got away from us."" Frattesi's winning goal, his seventh of the season and probably the most important of his career, was all the more incredible for the fact that Inter should by rights have already been eliminated. The hosts were heading out with two minutes remaining of regular time when Raphinha completed a comeback from two goals down at half-time and gave Barca a 3-2 lead on the night. But Francesco Acerbi stunned everyone in the stadium, not least the already-celebrating Barca supporters, when he forced home Denzel Dumfries' cross in the second minute of added time. That goal came as a bolt from the blue as Barca had been by far the better team in the second half of normal time after going in at the break behind to a brilliant Lautaro Martinez goal and Hakan Calhanoglu's penalty in first half stoppage-time. Eric Garcia and Dani Olmo pulled Barca level with goals in the 54th and 60th minutes, both from sumptuous Gerard Martin deliveries, and Yann Sommer had to be at his best to keep Inter within touching distance. Sommer made possibly the save of the season between Barca's first two goals, somehow stopping Eric Garcia from finishing off a lightning Barca counter-attack. And the Swiss ended up being crucial again in the 113th minute when he pulled off another miraculous save from Lamine Yamal, who hit the post just before Acerbi's equaliser. Inter then held off Barca as the home fans held their breath before unleashing a mighty roar at the final whistle of the match of the season.Â  RESULT Inter 4 (Martinez 21, Calhanoglu 45-P, Acerbi 90+3, Frattesi 99) Barcelona 3 (Garcia 54, Olmo 60, Raphinha 87) aet Inter won 7-6 on aggregate",sports

The sooner our interim government understands this, the better,â he said. Bangladesh Labour Party arranged the program titled ""Mawlana Abdul Matinâs Role in Building an Exploitation-Free Society"" at the Jatiya Press Club, marking the 29th death anniversary of Bangladesh Labour Party founder Maulana Abdul Matin.Â  Nazrul, a BNP Standing Committee member, questioned the logic behind delaying the national election, asking the interim government to explain the obstacles to holding the election by December. He pointed out that National Consensus Commission vice chair Professor Ali Riaz has recently expressed optimism that after discussions with all political parties, they will be able to reach a point by May where it will be clear which reform proposals all political parties agree upon and which proposals are subject to differing opinions. âIf we can understand this by May, is it not possible by Juneâ¦ We put together the proposals on which we all agree and prepare a charter, and we all sign it and agree that the reforms should be implemented immediately,â the BNP leader said. Nazrul said the reforms which could be implemented through laws or ordinances should be carried out immediately, while those requiring constitutional amendments could be addressed by the next elected parliament. âIf all political parties reached a consensus and signed a joint declaration, work would move forward based on that consensus. If such progress could be made by Juneâor even by Julyâhe questioned what obstacle could possibly remain to prevent the election from being held by December,â he said.Â  The BNP leader questioned the logic behind delaying the national election beyond December, saying that neither the Election Commission nor political realities justify such a delay. He also mentioned that the Election Commission itself has said it can complete all preparations by June. Nazrul said BNP and its like-minded parties had long proposed comprehensive reform agendasâfrom Ziaur Rahmanâs 19-point program to Tarique Rahmanâs 27-point and the 31-point state reform plan announced in 2023. He also said BNP is not against reform but fully in favour of it, adding that reform is a continuous process, not something to be completed all at once.",politics
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/381415/bnp-raises-alarm-over-election-delay,BNP raises alarm over election delay,"16 May 2025, 05:25 PM","They allege that the interim government appears to be dragging its feet and showing no sign of preparing for the polls Though the BNP has consistently called for a national election and swift reforms, party leaders now fear that their December election deadline may quietly slip away. They allege that the interim government appears to be dragging its feet and showing no sign of preparing for the polls. Speaking to the media, several senior BNP leaders expressed concern that nine months after the formation of the interim government, its lack of focus on electionsâalongside controversial moves such as allowing human corridors to Rakhine and outsourcing port operationsâhas raised serious doubts about its true intentions. In this context, they said, grassroots members are mounting pressure on the party leadership to take to the streets and compel the government to announce a clear election roadmap and hold the polls within this year. A BNP leader, requesting anonymity, said the party fears that the ban on Awami League activities, internal conflicts between the National Citizen Party (NCP) and Jamaat-e-Islami, the rise in unnecessary street protests, and the deteriorating law and order situation may further complicate the political landscape in the days ahead. He added that the party is also deeply concerned about the emerging political polarisation following the ban on Awami League activities and the suspension of its registration with the Election Commission. They suspect these developments may be part of a broader strategyâpossibly involving both local and international actorsâto prolong the tenure of the interim government. The BNP leader said the issues of election and reforms were discussed at their latest standing committee meeting, where most members expressed frustration over the lack of visible progress. He also noted that grassroots leaders and activists are increasingly pressuring the party to launch a movement demanding that the election be held by December. Three BNP Standing Committee members have recently voiced concern and anger over the delay. On Monday, senior BNP leader Mirza Abbas alleged that many suspicious foreigners are arriving in Bangladesh, accusing the interim government of serving foreign interests instead of the peopleâs. He further accused the government of orchestrating incidents to divert public attention from its failures and claimed that a deliberate effort is underway to eliminate the BNP. According to him, pro-BNP officials are being systematically replaced by those loyal to the Awami League or Jamaat-e-Islami in the administration and key government positions. A day earlier, BNP Standing Committee Member Salahuddin Ahmed said the party had repeatedly demanded that the Awami League, as a political entity, be brought to trialâbut those demands were ignored. âHad the chief adviser addressed the matter then, the embarrassing incidents of the last two daysâsuch as the Shahbagh demonstrationsâcould have been avoided,â he added. Claiming that people across the country are eager to vote in the next parliamentary election, he said: âWe urge the chief adviser to announce a clear roadmap for the upcoming election. Otherwise, similar embarrassing situations may recur.â On Tuesday, BNP Standing Committee Member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said that the party is ready to implement any reform proposals agreed upon through political consensus. âSo, why the delay? Why are we still unaware of the status of the consensus? Weâve submitted our proposals. Now weâre waiting to see where the consensus standsâbut there's still no clarity. What is causing this hesitation?â he asked. âYou cannot hold the people hostage while discussing reforms that benefit only a select few. That time is over. The people of Bangladesh will no longer accept anything imposed by force,â he warned. He also lamented that individuals who once remained silent in fear of Sheikh Hasina are now dictating the reform agenda. âEvery now and then, new distractions are introduced, reforms are dragged out, and the situation is kept deliberately unstable. It appears to be part of a larger conspiracy to indefinitely delay the election,â said another BNP Standing Committee member on condition of anonymity. He noted that the party is currently organizing youth rallies across all divisions to generate momentum and encourage the younger generation to engage in BNP politics. âOur divisional youth rally will culminate in a massive gathering in Dhaka on 28 May. From that platform, the BNP will deliver a strong message to the government, demanding that the election not be unnecessarily delayed,â the leader added. Contacted for comment, BNP Standing Committee Member Gayeshwar Chandra Roy said there is a clear effort to delay the election under various pretexts, including the reform process. âSuch delays could lead to greater instability and allow the Awami League to reorganize and create chaos. If elections are postponed, the situation may spiral out of control,â he warned. He emphasized that the interim government's role is to restore the peopleâs mandate, but it seems to lack the will to do so. âWe urge the government to present a clear electoral roadmap without further delay. The peopleâespecially the youthâare eager to vote. A fair election must be held, and the reforms must be completed quickly,â he concluded.",politics

""Jatiya Jubo Shakti"" formally emerged on Friday, around 5pm, at the capital's Shaheed Abrar Fahad Avenue in Gulistan. Advocate Tarikul Islam has been appointed convener, Dr Jahedul Islam as member secretary, and Engineer Forhad Sohel as chief organizer of the youth wing. Nasiruddin Patwary, chief coordinator of the National Citizen Party (NCP), announced the top leaders of ""Jatiya Jubo Shakti."" Dr Jahedul Islam announced the rest of the convening committee. Akhter Hossain, NCP's member secretary, emphasized the need to ideologically expel Awami League politics from Bangladesh. ""We believe that National Youth Power will play a leading role in the struggle to ensure fascism never returns to Bangladesh,"" he said. He further noted that the top three leaders of Jatiya Jubo Shakti include a doctor, an engineer, and an advocate, and that leadership roles will not be limited to central figures alone. ""Rather, we hope that National Youth Power will work to ensure that all its leaders and activists across the country can reach the highest peaks of success in their professional lives,"" he added. He highlighted how the youth of Bangladesh have historically guided the masses. ""We hope that National Youth Power, along with all the youth of this country, will become the protective shield of Bangladesh's independence and sovereignty,"" he said. Nasiruddin Patwary referred to the event as a historic moment. He stated that the fascist system has not yet been eliminated and that the struggle must continue. ""The fight to establish a new order and a dignified state will be led by Bangladesh's future youth power, who will carry the flag of struggle in tomorrowâs Bangladesh,"" he said. He also reminisced about forming 'Gonotantrik Chhatra Shakti' during his student daysâan organization that, he claimed, eventually helped topple the Awami League regime. Abdul Hannan Masud said that their youth wing will not operate merely as a band of enforcers, unlike conventional political parties. ""Our Youth Power will add a new dimension to politics, through which youth empowerment, training, and mobilization will strengthen the countryâs economy, society, and path of transformation,"" he added. Titled ""Towards a Dignified Bangladesh and New Order: The Youth's Conviction"", the declaration outlines a new vision for youth-led political change. It states that ""the time has come to build a new political order and a new republic,"" presenting the youth wing as the vanguard of generational change. At the core of its platform is the Bangladesh Doctrine, described as âa sovereign state concept rooted in the nationâs history, geography, culture, economy, and peopleâs struggles.â It is explicitly âanti-fascist and anti-aggression,â prioritizing sovereignty independent of global powers. âWe want politics of responsibility and compassion,â the declaration asserts, defining leadership as grounded in âresponsibility, empathy, tolerance, and initiative to solve citizensâ problems.â Their economic vision focuses on justice and equality, promising a ""corruption-free and merit-based state structure,"" youth employment opportunities, and innovation support. The declaration places strong emphasis on women's leadership, stating: ""Young women are not just participants; they will be the face of leadership in the new republic. Reconstruction of society and the state will be in womenâs hands."" Addressing challenges like unemployment, outdated education, and drug proliferation, National Youth Power demands state investment in creative employment and ethical education. Their central demand is for âa new political order and a new republicâ with a new constitution that reflects the aspirations of the current generation. The declaration concludes: âWe are not just the inheritanceâwe are the future.â National Youth Power commits to ensuring youth representation in politics, declaring: âTomorrowâs parliament and tomorrowâs Bangladesh will belong to the youth, to the new.â They refer to the current era as Politics 4.0, describing themselves as Youth Generation 4.0âdigitally adept and morally strong. They called on NGOs, development agencies, private sectors, government institutions, academia, and the media to join hands and build the future together. Â ",politics

BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi on Thursday suspected that Dhaka University Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) leader Shahriar Alam Shammo was killed for political reasons, as he raised his voice in favour of the national flag and anthem. âShammo held a position in the AF Rahman Hall unit of Chhatra Dal. What was the reason, and what wrong did Shammo commit to deserve such a fate? The police have arrested three vagabonds. We believe there is a political motive behind this murder,â he said at a human chain programme. The BNP leader questioned, if there was no political motive, why would a well-groomed, gentle young man like Shammo be subjected to murder? âWhy would vagabonds kill him? Who were Shammoâs political enemies? We are getting a few clues. So, identify these political enemies and bring them to justice immediately. Otherwise, the consequences will be dire,â he warned, pointing at the government. The Northern Region Studentsâ Forum organized the human chain in front of the Jatiya Press Club, demanding justice for the murder of Shahriar Alam Shammo, who hailed from Sirajganj district. Shammo, a student of Dhaka Universityâs Institute of Education and Research (IER) and the Literature and Publication Secretary of the Sir AF Rahman Hall unit of JCD, was stabbed to death near Suhrawardy Udyan around midnight on Tuesday. Just days ago, Rizvi said Shammo posted on Facebook in defence of the national anthem during a protest in Shahbagh demanding its ban. âCould this be why he was targeted?â he asked. âHe posted in favour of the national anthem. He delivered a message against those protesting the anthem. Was this the reason for his killing?â he asked. The BNP leader drew parallels with the political killing of Abrar Fahad in 2019. âJust as Abrar was murdered for speaking against the neighbouring countryâs aggression and water aggression, now Shammo has been killed for speaking in favour of the national anthem, the flag, or our independence. Thatâs why I said, there must be a political reason behind it.â He urged the police to thoroughly investigate the murder of the JCD leader, expressing doubt over the arrest of the three vagabonds. âWhy are there still bodies lying on the campus? Why is there still blood on the campus? Why is there still bloodshed inside the university grounds? The associates of the Awami League are no longer in power,â he observed. Rizvi also criticised the Dhaka University Vice-Chancellor for allegedly mistreating JCD leaders who had approached him seeking justice for Shammoâs murder. âYou became irritated, angry, and even addressed them disrespectfully. Why? Just because Shammo was from Chhatra Dal?â he questioned. âWe know your political ideology. You and your proctor follow a specific belief and do not favour those who represent nationalist views on campus. If university authorities act like gang leaders trying to impose their ideology, then it is no longer a university,â he said. The BNP leader noted that a Vice-Chancellor may have personal beliefs, but when he becomes an administrator, he must act impartially. âIf you try to enforce your ideology instead of ensuring peace, the campus will never be peaceful.â He also urged the interim government to run the country wisely and inclusively. âLook in all directions.

It was us who installed you in the office. We have many demands from the government, but we donât take to the streets for that,â he said. The BNP leader said that some political parties, who have already declared their candidates across the country and begun their election campaigns, criticize BNP for continually demanding the election.

The BNP leader said the people of Bangladesh ousted the mafia regime of Sheikh Hasina through a 16-year struggle for the restoration of democracy. âWhy should we still remain in the dark? The most popular party, BNP, also does not know what kind of corridor it is or what will be done with it.â He said there is no alternative for Bangladesh but to gain strength by utilising its military and the younger generation. âMyanmar is a country of six crore people, while we are a country of 18 crore. What is the purpose of maintaining our large army? Will it only be used to rescue empty canals and rivers, distribute relief, and build bridges? Or is its main task to safeguard our independence by empowering the people? A state decision is needed on this matter,â the BNP leader said. He said that strong unity among the people is essential, as Bangladesh has a very vibrant young population. âWe, being imbued with nationalist spirit, must turn Bangladesh into a powerful country. We want to remain united; we will not be involved in any kind of aggression. Our goal is overall economic emancipation and progress.

Khasru made these comments on Tuesday at a memorial event marking the third death anniversary of Dr Zafrullah Chowdhury, held at the Abdus Salam Hall of the National Press Club. He warned that without democracy, there can be no true reform, and without elections, the people cannot reclaim ownership of their country. The BNP leader said that a psychological shift is taking place among the people of Bangladesh in the aftermath of the retreat of fascist forces. The critical question now, he said, is whether this transformation can be realised and sustained. âIf we are to return ownership of the country to its people, a democratic order must be restored through elections.

What we are seeing now appears to be a continuation of the same old practices in a new guise,â he said. Referring to ongoing discussions about reform, he pointed out that the BNP had earlier proposed a 27-point reform agenda, followed by a 31-point outline, while BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia had presented Vision 2030 as a roadmap for reform. âBut those who now speak of reform were neither seen in the movement nor on the streets. Some briefly emerged, but when faced with pressure from Sheikh Hasinaâs regime, they disappeared undergroundâonly to now reappear and lecture us on reform,â he said. He further said: âRegardless of how much one speaks of reform, in the end, it must come through a democratic process. Reforms outside democratic legitimacy are not acceptable. No one has been entrusted with the ownership of this country to impose unilateral reform. Reforms must be endorsed by the people of Bangladesh, through democratic means. There is no scope for any alternative.â Reiterating the BNPâs stance, he said: âWe have clearly stated that we are ready to engage with any reform initiative based on national consensus. Then why the delay? Why are we not being informed where that consensus lies? All political parties have submitted proposals. We are waiting. They talk of consensus, we talk of consensusâso where is it, and why is it not being disclosed?â âSheikh Hasina used to claim that development takes precedence and that elections and human rights could wait.

He further stated how this youth community shattered the shackles of discrimination by taking to the streets. âWe believe the future of Bangladesh will be determined by the hands of these young people,â Patwary added. The committee for the wing has already been drafted, and those in charge of its formation have been instructed to ensure the participation of women and religious minoritiesâHindus, Buddhists, and Christians. One of the main focuses of the youth wing will be mobilizing private university students, who are expected to participate in large numbers. âStudents from both private and public universities are students, and we donât want to categorize them at all,â added Patwary.

The NCP made the statement through a press release issued by Joint Office Secretary Saleh Uddin Sifat on Monday. The party said that although various political parties, ideological groups and members of the public participated spontaneously in the movement demanding the banning of the Awami League as a terrorist organization, the inclusion of provisions for party-based trials under the International Crimes Tribunal Act and the issuance of a âJuly proclamation,â one group deliberately raised slogans opposing the historical struggles of the Bangladeshi people. The NCP clarified that none of its members participated in chanting such slogans. It added that the responsibility for these controversial slogans lies solely with the group that voiced them and termed any attempt to associate the NCP with this unnecessary and inappropriate. Instead, the party maintained that the slogans and speeches of its members reflected the countryâs historic struggles of 1947, 1971, and 2024. The NCP also noted that when objections were raised by a particular group during the singing of the national anthem at the protests, the demonstrators performed it resolutely, demonstrating a sense of national commitment. The party asserted that political engagement in Bangladesh requires proper recognition of the key historical milestones of 1947, 1971 and 2024. The NCP called on those who opposed the war of 1971 and who face allegations of aiding in genocide to clarify their political stance before the nation and to work towards strengthening national consensus and unity by supporting the public aspirations that emerged from the 2024 uprising. It added that individuals who suffered repression under the fascist regime and played a role in the 2024 uprising must continue to act in a pro-Bangladesh spirit in building a new nation. The party believes that any political group whose past ideologies contributed to division and discord has a duty to publicly clarify its position and help pave the way towards unity. The NCP said defeating ""Mujibism"" in a comprehensive manner is only possible through greater unity among the people of Bangladesh. It called on all parties to take farsighted decisions and behave responsibly for a better and prosperous future of the countryâs citizens.",politics

He made this statement on Monday while speaking as the chief guest at a memorial discussion held at the National Press Club in honour of former MP Nasir Uddin Pintu. Mirza Abbas said: âThere are many advisers in the current government who are not even citizens of Bangladesh, yet they are the ones running the country. Attempts are being made to divert attention from this. Are we under colonial rule? We are not governed by our people, we are under colonial control.â Claiming that the overall state of the country is not good, he added: âAre we living in a subjugated state? Why am I not allowed to visit St Martinâs, Sajek, or Baghaichhari? We fought a war to free this country, not to sell it off. The country is not in a good place. Now we hear talk of a âhumanitarian corridorâ. Whose interest does that serve?â He continued: âThere is no such term as âhumanitarian corridorâ in any dictionary in the world. Is the government importing new terms now? It should be the people of Bangladesh and their elected representatives who decide whether such a corridor is acceptable.â He further stated: âThe number of suspicious foreign individuals entering the country has increased. Various new missions are being launched. The government is deliberately carrying out all sorts of wrongdoing. It is serving someone elseâs agenda; this is not a patriotic government.â On the issue of Rohingya repatriation, the BNP leader said: âIt was only president Ziaur Rahman who once forced Myanmar to take back the Rohingya. Only the BNP can save Bangladesh from foreign influence.â Commenting on recent protests in Shahbagh calling for a ban on the Awami League, he said: âThe drama at Shahbagh went on for several days. How is it that the ruling administrationâs affiliate, the NCP, can organize protests in areas where gatherings are usually banned? And what are they even protesting for?â He pointed out that over 15 years, the BNP faced the most persecution at the hands of the Awami League.Â  âThe critics keep attacking the BNP in various ways. They claim the BNP is trying to rehabilitate the Awami League. Why would we do that? For 15 years, we suffered under their oppression, separated from our families, aged due to their persecutionâ¦ why would we rehabilitate them?â",politics

The president on Saturday promulgated the International Crimes (Tribunals) (Second Amendment) Ordinance, 2025, amending the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973. The amendment was published in a gazette the same day. Under the new provisions, the definition of âorganizationâ has been broadened to include not only political parties but also any entity affiliated with, subordinate to, or associated with such parties, or any group of individuals that propagates, supports, endorses, facilitates, or engages in their activities. The most significant change comes through the newly inserted Section 20B, which authorizes the tribunal to take punitive actions against organizations if it finds credible evidence that they committed, aided, incited, or otherwise facilitated war crimes. âNotwithstanding anything contained in this act or any other law for the time being in force, if it appears to the tribunal that any organization has committed or assisted in committing any of the crimes under Section 3(2), the tribunal shall have the power to suspend or prohibit its activities, ban the organization, suspend or cancel its registration or license, and confiscate its property,â the gazette reads. The amendment, passed overnight, followed just hours after the interim administration imposed a blanket ban on all operations of the Bangladesh Awami League. The decision came amid mounting protests by July Uprising student groups demanding a ban on the ousted party. Led by the National Citizen Party (NCP) leaders Nahid Islam and Hasnat Abdullah, demonstrators rallied outside the chief adviserâs residence before assembling at Shahbagh on the night. That night, an emergency meeting chaired by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus approved the ban and endorsed ICT Act amendments to prosecute political parties as entities. At a post-meeting briefing on Saturday night, Law Adviser Asif Nazrul emphasized: âThis amendment empowers the prosecution of organizations implicated in crimes against humanity, where credible evidence of institutional complicity exists.â He also confirmed that, under the Anti-Terrorism Act, all Awami League activitiesâboth physical and digitalâwould remain suspended until the conclusion of the ongoing ICT trials against its senior leaders.",politics

Speaking to journalists during a visit to the local community in Chhatihaati village of Kalihati upazila in Tangail, he said: âA wave of hostility is currently sweeping through the nation. But one must understandâthis is Sheikh Hasinaâs party, the party founded by Maulana Bhashani and the party guided by Bangabandhu. It is the very party that brought about Bangladeshâs independence.â Addressing the interim government's decision to ban the Awami League's activities, Kader Siddique said: âYou cannot erase a political party simply by declaring it banned. A party loses ground only when the people turn away from it. Even with official approval, a party cannot stand if it loses public support.â He emphasized that any wrongdoing or misjudgment committed by members of the Awami League must be held accountable under the law. He said: âThose proven guilty in the eyes of the court must be punished. However, the decision of any single council does not automatically render it just or valid.â On a question about the possible implications of an India-Pakistan war on Bangladesh, Kader warned that modern warfare is no childâs play. âFiring a few bullets and waging a full-scale war are not the same. An India-Pakistan war would be catastrophic, with global repercussions. The Indian government is making gestures to appeal to public sentiment, but many are beginning to see through it. This is not true politics.â He added: âIndia is a country of master strategistsâarguably the best drivers in the world. Why would they act recklessly? It is those in power today who are playing war games and suffering as a result. The people of India are already facing the consequences. Should war break out, the entire world will be affected.""

Although there is largely a consensus on holding the ousted party accountable for its actions over the past 16 years, not all sections agree on an outright ban. Protestersâcamping in Shahbagh since Friday nightâare demanding that the interim government formally outlaw the Awami League. They insist the blockade will persist until an official notification is issued declaring the party illegal. Mass gatherings at sites commemorating the July uprising have erupted nationwide, marking what organizers call the âsecond uprising phase.â From Shahbagh, they aim to press a three-point agenda demanding the ban.Â  Furthermore, at 2pm on Saturday, a five-member delegation of the Gono Odhikar Parishad submitted an eight-point memorandum to the Interim Chief Adviserâs office, calling for the Awami League to be classified as a fascist party and subjected to a genocide trial. Various political groups have thrown their support behind the ban. The Gono Songhoti Andolon contends that the Awami Leagueâs fifteen-year rule amounted to a reign of terror, characterized by enforced disappearances, corruption, suppression of dissent, voter disenfranchisement, looting and money laundering.Â  âMore than 1,500 students, workers and civilians were massacred during protests in July and August, and thousands more were injured,â said Gono Songhoti Andolon Chief Coordinator Zonayed Saki.Â  Gono Songhoti Andolon Executive Coordinator Abul Hasan Rubel warned that only formal proscription and legal action could halt further atrocities. NCP convener Nahid Islam told reporters that his partyâs demands include declaring the Awami League a terrorist organization and amending the International Crimes Tribunal Act to allow party-based trials, as well as issuing a July Declaration. Movement leaders have vowed to maintain the Shahbagh standoff indefinitely. Blockade points have multiplied across Dhaka, and organizers warn that, should the government delay, demonstrators from every corner of the country will converge on the capital once more. In contrast, BNP Standing Committee member Gayeshwar Chandra Roy argued at a 12-party alliance rally at the National Press Club on Saturday that banning political parties ânever solves any problem.âÂ  He insisted that democratic norms and the rule of law must determine which parties remain legitimate.Â  BNPâs senior figures, speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, echoed this view: while they back calls for fair trials of the Awami Leagueâs leadership for alleged atrocities against BNP activists, they oppose an outright ban, warning that suppression drives movements underground and often strengthens them. A statement from the Chief Adviserâs Press Wing on Friday said the government is âseriously consideringâ the various ban petitions. Talks with political parties are underway, and a final decision will follow further consultation. Activists involved in the blockade have been urged to exercise patience in the meantime. A senior politician, preferring anonymity, cautioned that banning established parties such as the Awami League, BNP or Jamaat often has the unintended effect of allowing their leaders and supporters to regroup underground. âLook at Jamaat-e-Islami,â he noted. âAfter its 2013 ban, it became more organized and vocal over the next fifteen years.â Legally, the governmentâs power to proscribe parties is constrained. Under Section 18 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 2009, authorities may ban any person or organization believed to threaten national sovereignty. Yet the Political Parties Ordinance of 1978 requires that any proposal to dissolve a registered party be referred to the High Court, which hears arguments from both sides and issues a binding judgment. Barrister Jyotirmoy Barua of the Supreme Court said: âExecutive power alone cannot proscribe a political party; all legal criteria must be met, and the ultimate decision must rest with the judiciary.â As the Shahbagh standoff drags on and legal debates intensify, Bangladesh faces a pivotal choice: to use proscription as a tool against alleged tyranny, or to uphold democratic safeguards that ensure every partyâeven the most controversialâhas access to due process.",politics

Tarique Rahman said: âBy wasting time in the name of reforms, the government is facilitating the escape of allies of the fugitive autocrat. At the same time, efforts are underway to create divisions among anti-fascist parties. Attempts are being made to rehabilitate the accomplices of fugitive fascism.â Claiming that the Awami League had turned the Constitution of Bangladesh into a party document, he added: âThe aspirations with which the Liberation War was fought were never reflected during the Awami League's rule. They transformed the constitution into their own party charter.â He continued: âTo truly realize the spirit of the Liberation War, there is no alternative to reforming the constitution while preserving the core principles of equality, human dignity, and social justice. We have presented these matters to the interim government as a party.â Questioning whether the interim government is fulfilling its responsibilities properly, the BNP leader said: âQuestions are being raised from various sections of society about whether the government is carrying out its duties.

Tarique said the police later claimed they were unaware of Sumonâs disappearance. ""For the sake of argument, letâs assume they were unaware of Sumonâs case. But a former president, who served during the autocratic regime, was able to leave the country through the airport yesterday (early Thursday),"" he said.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/380557/ncp-announces-fundamental-reform-plan-for,What is the NCPâs vision for a restructured governance system?,"06 May 2025, 09:53 PM","The National Citizen Party (NCP) has announced a wide-ranging proposal for fundamental reforms to Bangladesh's constitutional framework and governance structure. The initiative, announced through a press release on Tuesday, aims to decentralize power, ensure accountability, and restore democratic norms across state institutions. The NCP presented these plans to the National Consensus Committee earlier in the day. The NCP proposes the formation of a National Constitutional Council (NCC) that would ensure accountability within the executive branch. Under the proposed system, the NCC would serve as the sole recommending body for key constitutional appointments, with the president making appointments based exclusively on these recommendations. The NCP proposal excludes only positions in the defence forces and the attorney general's office from this arrangement. The party also advocates for a significant restructuring of the legislature, recommending a bicameral system with a lower house elected through first-past-the-post voting and an upper house based on proportional representation. This upper house would have several crucial responsibilities, including passing constitutional amendments with a two-thirds majority, reviewing bills from the lower house, approving international treaties, and monitoring public institutions. According to the NCP, the reforms would enhance parliamentary democracy by introducing constitutional safeguards allowing MPs to express opinions freely while maintaining governmental stability. In a move to increase youth participation, the NCP proposes setting the voting age at 16 and the candidate eligibility age at 23, while also recognizing the right to information as a fundamental right. Women's empowerment also features in the proposal, with plans for 100 parliamentary seats to be directly elected by women. The platform also calls for referendums on major constitutional amendments, creating a mechanism that would block changes with just 35-40% opposition votes. The NCP proposes that one person can be prime minister for two times in their lifetime that and no person can simultaneously be the head of a party, prime minister and the leader of parliament. They also propose that legally mandated parliamentary standing committees shall be formed, with chairs of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), planning, public administration, and home ministry committees specifically required to be from opposition parties. And chairpersons of the parliamentary standing committees must come from the opposition. Additionally, the reforms include provisions allowing for a vote of no confidence against the prime minister to be tabled, strengthening legislative oversight of the executive branch. The NCP proposes appointing the chief election commissioner and other commissioners through the National Constitutional Council (NCC), granting the Election Commission authority to create its own administrative structure and budget, and introducing accountability measures including judicial review of commissioners by a Supreme Judicial Council in cases of serious misconduct, bias, corruption, abuse of power, or constitutional violations. It also calls for the creation of an independent, non-partisan, and constitutionally established Delimitation Commission to redraw electoral boundaries, removing this power from the Election Commission. Additionally, they propose classifying vote-buying with money as a criminal offence, enacting provisions allowing election results to be cancelled if fraud is proven even after gazette notification, and voting rights for expatriates through postal ballots, embassy-based voting, and a secure online voting system. The reform package targets laws seen as repressive, calling for the repeal of the Special Powers Act 1974 and the amendment of preventive detention provisions under Article 33(3) of the constitution. Under the proposed changes, detainees would need to be informed of the reasons for arrest, granted access to legal representation, and presented before courts within 24 hours of detention. These proposals represent the most comprehensive constitutional reform agenda put forward in Bangladesh in recent years, the NCP says, with the party emphasizing that they aim to dismantle structures identified as promoting authoritarian tendencies in the current system. The party states that their approach would help restore public trust in democratic governance, which they suggest has been eroded. According to the NCP, these comprehensive reforms aim to address long-standing governance issues and improve public service delivery across Bangladesh, potentially setting the stage for significant political discourse in the coming months. For judicial independence, the NCP proposes establishing a dedicated administrative secretariat for the judiciary, forming a Supreme Judicial Council, and implementing a seniority-based appointment system for the chief justice. The plan calls for creating a Judicial Commission and introducing merit-based examinations for judge appointments, developing an impartial evaluation system for promotions to the Appellate Division, and establishing permanent High Court benches in divisional cities across the country. On anti-corruption measures, the NCP calls for significant strengthening of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), including recognition of the ACC as a constitutional institution and granting it independence to file cases against government and judicial officials. The platform specifically advocates abolishing Section 32(a) of the current law that requires prior government permission before investigating officials, providing full authority to directly investigate, file cases, and arrest government and judicial officials suspected of corruption. For local governance reforms, the NCP emphasizes eliminating party-symbol-based elections at the local level and implementing necessary constitutional amendments to establish true local government rather than merely local administration. It also proposes introducing a ""right to recall"" provision for elected local representatives.Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   The civil service reform proposals include enacting a Citizen Service Guarantee Act and strengthening existing Citizen Charters with legal backing. The NCP suggests establishing an independent statutory Citizen Service and Grievance Redressal Commission as an administrative ombudsman and directly linking service delivery to the performance evaluation of civil servants. The party recommends creating provisions to deduct ""demerit points"" from the Annual Confidential Reports of officials who deliberately deny services or are proven to harass citizens. Additionally, it proposes forming a new Administrative Development and Reform Division under the Cabinet Division by combining existing units, creating a task force to modernize and harmonize laws and regulations, and simplifying service delivery processes. The proposals also include ensuring legal and institutional protection for government employees against political pressure and setting reasonable timeframes for service delivery for each government employee based on their workload.",politics

The platform, comprising political, social, and cultural organizations, was unveiled at Madhur Canteen of the University of Dhaka. Musaddiq Ibne Ali Mohammad, a DU student and activist, read out the platform's written statement. According to members, July Unity has already been approached by 35 organizations and has called for a human chain on Wednesday in front of the National Press Club. Rafe Salman Rifat, a leader from the upcoming party United People's Bangladesh, said the International Crimes Tribunal and prosecution team have been unable to accelerate the trial process of the Awami League due to the scale of killings that have occurred. ""Our primary demand to the government is to take necessary steps to expedite the trial process through the International Crimes Tribunal and the prosecution team,"" he said. âWe believe that, through a judicial process, the Awami League will ultimately be declared ineligible to engage in politics in Bangladesh, as it has proven to be a fascist party,â he added.

""We aim to build a united movement with everyone to ensure the Awami League is banned,"" he said. Fatima Tasnim Juma, member secretary of Inquilab Manchaâs Dhaka University Convening Committee, said achieving ""our second independence"" will not be possible unless the Awami League is banned. She accused the party of orchestrating mass killings at Shapla Chattar, in Pilkhana, and during the anti-Modi movement. âWe are demanding that the Awami League be banned and that arrangements be made for their trial.

The air ambulance carrying Khaleda Zia landed at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 10:38am. Khaleda Zia was accompanied by her daughter-in-law, Dr Zubaida Rahman, wife of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who came to Bangladesh for the first time in 17 years. She was also joined by her other daughter-in-law, Syeda Sharmila Rahman and 13 others, including her medical team and doctors from the board overseeing her treatment. Khaleda Zia was welcomed with flowers by BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, alongside other senior party leaders. At 11:20am, under tight security, she left the airport. Her motorcade passed through Khilkhet, Kurmitola and the Navy headquarters, finally arriving at her residence, Firoza, in Gulshan at 1:25pm. Thousands of BNP leaders and supporters had lined the roads from the airport to her Gulshan home, waving the national flag and party flag in a massive show of support. Khaleda Zia responded to the crowdâs cheers by waving from her car. Chants of âWelcome Khaleda Ziaâ and âKhaleda Zia bhoy nai, rajpoth chhari naiâ echoed along the route. Although party leaders had instructed supporters to stay on the sidewalks to avoid inconveniencing the public, the sheer size of the crowd made it difficult to maintain order.Â  Many became emotional upon seeing her enter Gulshan and stepped onto the main road, chanting slogans. Law enforcement eventually lost control of the crowd. Residents from surrounding high-rise buildings also joined in the welcome, waving to the former prime minister from their balconies. Speaking to the media in front of Firoza, BNP Standing Committee Member Professor AZM Zahid Hossain, who is also Khaleda Ziaâs personal physician, said: âShe has returned in much better physical and mental condition. Alhamdulillah, her health has significantly improved. She is mentally stable as well.â He also asked the public to pray for her continued recovery. Zahid expressed gratitude on behalf of Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman to the amir of Qatar and the Qatari authorities for providing the royal air ambulance free of charge. The 79-year-old former prime minister has long suffered from various health complications, including liver cirrhosis, kidney issues, heart problems, diabetes and arthritis. On January 7, she travelled to London aboard a royal air ambulance sent by the amir of Qatar for advanced treatment. She was under the care of specialists Prof Patrick Kennedy and Prof Jennifer Cross at the London Clinic. After 17 days of hospital treatment, she stayed at her son Tarique Rahmanâs residence from January 25 onwards. She departed from Londonâs Heathrow Airport at 4:20pm on Monday local time aboard the Qatari royal air ambulance.

Joint Secretary General Maulana Azizul Haque Islamabadi issued a statement to the media regarding the matter on Tuesday. Azizul clarified that Hefazat does not endorse any objectionable language. He said: âAt our grand rally, two speakers unintentionally used inappropriate language, which we do not support. We sincerely apologize to anyone who may have been hurt by it. ""At the same time, we urge those from secular progressive circles, who have long insulted Islamic scholars by labelling them as âmilitants,â âfundamentalists,â âreligious traders,â and âcommunal,â to also refrain from using such objectionable language. We have not forgotten who encouraged the Awami fascist forces during the Shapla Chattar massacre.â Azizul continued: âThere is absolutely no question of us harbouring hatred toward women. To interpret ideological disagreements as hatred toward women is sheer ignorance."" ""Once again, we emphasize that we are willing to participate in reform initiatives aimed at ensuring women's rightful entitlements, in accordance with their respective religious guidelines. However, from the outset, a group of NGO-aligned feminists was selected to form the Womenâs Reform Commission, deliberately excluding Islamic scholars and other religious experts,"" he added. ""As a result, a biased report has been producedâone that protects the interests and ideologies of the secular progressive women's community while neglecting the religious perspectives and concerns of the broader devout female population. This kind of discrimination is unacceptable.â The Hefazat leader said: âThe false political narrative of labelling us as misogynists by an extremist Islamophobic faction is nothing new. Yet, across the country, the number of female students in our women's Qawmi madrasas continues to rise significantly every year. These madrasasâoperating without any government fundingâprovide free accommodation, meals, security, and religious education to thousands of underprivileged and marginalized girls. ""As a result, we have made a noteworthy contribution to increasing women's literacy rates in this country. However, the social contributions of Islamic scholars are never acknowledged."" Azizul said: ""We believe that our social roles and religious positions are seen as obstacles by the imperialist forces seeking to implement a Western agenda that commodifies women. That is why they have unleashed a group of extremist feminists against us. ""But we warn: if there is any excess when it comes to religious matters, we will not tolerate it.â",politics

Zubaida became entangled in legal issues during the 1/11 military-backed caretaker government and under the subsequent Awami League administration.

Zubaida was later sentenced to three years in prison and fined Tk3.5 million by a Dhaka court. The sentence was subsequently stayed following the fall of the Awami League government in August last year. Born in Sylhet on May 18, 1972, Zubaida was admitted to Dhaka Medical College at her parentsâ insistence after passing her higher secondary examinations with distinction. She married Tarique Rahman on February 3, 1994. Zubaida passed the MBBS examination with top merit and began her career as a government doctor after qualifying through the BCS in 1995.

The BNP has made extensive preparations to welcome its leader back. At an emergency press conference held on Sunday at the partyâs central office in Naya Paltan, BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi shared the party's reception plans and issued detailed instructions to party leaders and activists. Rizvi said BNP leaders and activists will stand in an orderly manner along one side of the road, each carrying the national flag in one hand and the party flag in the other. However, he emphasized that no one will be allowed to enter the airport or Khaleda Ziaâs residence. Additionally, Rizvi made it clear that the use of motorcycles or walking alongside the motorcade will be strictly prohibited.

Shamsuddin Didar, a press wing member of BNP said that the reception would reflect the partyâs respect for its leader and its commitment to maintaining discipline. He emphasized the need for unity and peace during the event. Shairul Kabir Khan added that the air ambulance carrying Khaleda Zia had been arranged as a mark of gratitude from the Emir of Qatar for the longstanding relationship between the two nations. Earlier, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir confirmed that party leaders would officially welcome Khaleda Zia upon her arrival. He also requested that the public avoid the main road from the airport to Kakoli on Tuesday and instead use the elevated expressway to ease traffic flow. Khaleda Zia was flown to London on January 8 for advanced medical treatment. She was admitted to the London Clinic for 17 consecutive days.

He made the statement at a discussion titled âTrial for genocide, dialogue, reform, and the upcoming electionâ at the Zahur Hossain Chowdhury Hall of the National Press Club in Dhaka. âYou want to lull us to sleep by singing the song of reform, while calling for elections becomes our crime?â GayeshwarÂ said. He added: âFor 17 years, we have been committing this so-called crime by demanding a fair election. The BNP will keep committing this crime until elections are held.â He alleged that Sheikh Hasina, during her tenure as prime minister, created new issues from time to time to stay in power: âOver the past 16 years, she created at least 200 to 250 issues.""Â  Referring to recent developments at the Myanmar border, he said: âSuddenly, the Arakan issue has come up at the frontier. Yet they say it is not final. But there are discussions and intentions behind it.â Gayeshwar pointed out that had Hasina resigned on August 5, elections would have had to be held within 90 days, as per constitutional rules. He said: âSo why is the Election Commission now saying it needs a year and a half to two years to prepare? Is it acceptable to wait two years for elections every time there is a change in government?â Describing elections as the most vital reform, he said: âReform should follow the election. The election itself is the biggest reform. The system has been made a mockery of through four consecutive elections.â He added: âTherefore, our demand is for a free, fair, and impartial election. A democratic framework must first be established to enable further reform.â He acknowledged the need for reform but stressed the importance of practicality: âReform is essential, but it must be grounded in reality. We must not aim for reforms that are ultimately unachievable.â On political vendettas, he said: âThe BNP has never engaged in a politics of vengeance. This has made it easy for many to think that criticizing the BNP is the safest option. Journalists used to say they could not write against the ruling party due to a lack of press freedom, so they targeted the BNP instead.â He added: âBut press freedom does not mean freedom for journalists alone; it mostly depends on the freedom of media owners and publishers.â He also said: âSome media owners have reached understandings with the government and avoid publishing anything against it. While many outlets are financially strong, they still fail to pay journalists properly.â On the judicial system, GayeshwarÂ said: âThe court has become our second homeâwe must appear there frequently.â He added: âEven the chief adviser was once inundated with cases.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/380378/who-can-pull-the-islamic-parties-closer-together,Who can pull the Islamic parties closer together?,"05 May 2025, 09:00 AM","These parties aim either to form a grand alliance to rival the BNP or to secure a significant share of its seats through unity and compromise Islamic parties are uniting ahead of the elections, and efforts are underway to include moderate parties in the process. In this preâelection context, the BNP, JamaatâeâIslami and the newly formed National Citizens Party (NCP) are all attempting to draw Islamist parties closer together. The Islamist parties have two main objectives: either to rival the BNP by forming a grand alliance, or to win a significant number of seats from the BNP through unity and compromise. However, these parties remain uncertain about a coalition because of JamaatâeâIslamiâs stance, despite its status as one of the leading Islamist parties. Meanwhile, five Qawmi madrasaâbased parties are negotiating an electoral alliance. It is widely known that the BNP is courting these leading Islamist factions. When asked whether the five likeâminded parties would ally with the BNP or with Jamaat, Islami Andolan Bangladeshâs SecretaryâGeneral Yunus Ahmad declared: âWe have decided that whatever the five parties do, we will do it together. If we ally with any party, we will all do so collectively. No one will act alone.â Since August 5, the Qawmi madrasaâbased parties affiliated with HefazatâeâIslam have maintained that their goal in the next election is to âbring Islamist votes into one box.â On April 17, Khelafat Majlis, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish, Jamiat UlemaâeâIslam and NizamâeâIslam Party met to negotiate and reiterated the same objective. The Islamic Andolan, led by Charmonai Pir, has also joined this bloc, making it the secondâlargest religious party in electoral politics after Jamaat. They agreed that in the next election they will field a single candidate in each constituencyâand remain united regardless of outcomeâand insist that national polls be held within a reasonable time after essential reforms. These activities rest on the assumption that the Awami Leagueâousted during the student-public uprisingâwill be unable to contest the elections. Despite longâstanding differences and political conflicts among Islamist parties in Bangladesh, the slogan âbringing votes into one boxâ has now become a unifying rallying cry ahead of the vote. One of these groups, HefazatâeâIslam Bangladesh, met with the BNP last month and agreed that elections should be held in December, provided necessary reforms are implemented. Hefazat has publicly stated it has no objection to a December poll accompanied by these reforms. Subsequently, a meeting between Islami Andolan and Gana Adhikar Parishad produced a consensus that elections should follow fundamental reforms, with local elections first and voting conducted under a proportional system. Although HefazatâeâIslam itself is a nonâpolitical organization, many of its top leaders head separate Islamic political parties. These leaders believe an electoral alliance with the BNP is possibleâbut only time will tell. JamaatâeâIslami continues informal discussions with Hefazat and other Islamist groups, while Islamic Andolan Bangladesh seeks to build an even larger Islamic alliance before the vote. Thus, Jamaatânot the BNPâis their preferred major partner, whereas many smaller Islamist factions lean toward the BNP. Ataullah Amin, Joint SecretaryâGeneral of Bangladesh Khilafat Majlis, explained: âOur primary goal is to maintain unity while keeping an equal distance from both the BNP and Jamaat. Any future alliance will depend on the environment and situation immediately before the election.â Officially, the BNP says it will not consider alliances prior to the polls. Yet several of its top leaders have indicated they intend to contest the election alongside likeâminded Islamic parties. Since the fall of the Awami League regime in the July mass uprising, the political activity of Jamaat and other Islamic parties has increased markedly. Their leaders now feel an urgency to unite or form alliances, believing that the countryâs political change offers them a real opportunity to secure a lasting place in governance. Despite these negotiations, they have not made clear which concessions they are willing to offer in the next electionâeven as they continue talks with both the BNP and Jamaat. While discussions with the NCP are ongoing, many view an agreement as unlikely, given the partyâs current electoral weakness. Prof Muhammad Yunus, head of the interim government in Bangladesh, has suggested national elections could be held between December and June. Both JamaatâeâIslami and Islamic Andolan share this timeline, whereas the BNP insists on a December vote this year. As one Islamic party leader observed: âThe NCP is still weak. We could form an alliance with the BNPâbut the BNP has not clarified whether it will concede seats for consensus. They are trying to keep us on side with assurances. Recently, BNP leaders have begun labelling Islamists as fundamentalists. We will not be used any longer.â Jamaatâs Assistant SecretaryâGeneral and former lawmaker Hamidur Rahman Azad added that there is both formal and informal contact with all parties: âJamaat favors unity and has no problem with any party. However, any alliance formed too early must be sustainable.â Now, Islamist parties are discussing an electoral pact to field a single candidate per seat in the national parliamentary elections. Almost all active Islamist factions now oppose the ousted Awami Leagueâand many politicians believe that, under these conditions, the BNP could emerge victorious.Â  A senior BNP leader confirmed: âWe want to keep various Islamist parties closeâeven those outside our movement. That is why we continue these discussions.â",politics

""It is necessary to move away from a mindset of doubt for the sake of democracy. Our media needs to engage more in this practice. Practising democracy is vital.â Emphasizing the BNPâs support for press freedom, he said: âIt was our party that first liberated the press in 1975. Before that, all newspapers had been shut down. When president Ziaur Rahman took power, he reopened the media and granted them freedom. I can confidently say that we have worked more than anyone else for the freedom of the press.â He continued: âWe have always been, and will continue to be, in favour of press freedomâwhether we are in government or not. We will never support the imposition of oneâs views on others. We strongly support freedom of opinion. That is our philosophy. We will continue to fight for press freedom.â The senior BNP leader said: âWe are in a transitional period. Many things are happeningâthere is tension and turmoil. There is a crisisâthere is no democracy. We have been fighting for 15 years for a democratic transition. The mass uprising of July 2024 has opened up an opportunity to oust a fascist regime and establish a democratic system.â Asserting that the BNP is a pro-reform party, he added: âThere is propaganda against us suggesting we oppose reforms. But we do not oppose reformsâwe want elections. In fact, the concept of reform began with us. It was we who transitioned from a one-party system to a multi-party system. We also shifted from a presidential to a parliamentary system of government. Attempts to question us unnecessarily and portray us differently may carry some political motives.â On the topic of the Liberation War, he firmly stated: âFor us, the 1971 Liberation War is a matter of great importance. Our ideology revolves around it. That is what we fought for, gave our lives for, and endured unimaginable suffering for nine long months. We will not compromise on this point.

""She is scheduled to arrive at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka on Monday,"" Mirza Fakhrul announced in a press conference at the political office of the BNP chairperson in Gulshan on Saturday night. Mirza Fakhrul confirmed that Khaleda Zia will be accompanied by her two daughters-in-lawâDr Zubaida Rahman and Sharmila Rahman. He said: ""Madam Khaleda Zia has been undergoing treatment in London for the past four months. Initially, she received care at a hospital in the UK, and based on doctorsâ advice, she later continued her treatment at the residence of our acting chairman, Tarique Rahman. Her condition has steadily improved each day. ""Thanks to advanced treatment, a peaceful family environment, and the mercy of the Almighty, she is now feeling significantly better. As a result, she has decided to return home.â He added: âWe expect her to arrive on May 5 via a special aircraftâthe royal air ambulance provided by the Qatari royal family. However, the exact time is yet to be confirmed, as it depends on permissions from multiple countries. Once finalized, we will inform the public through the media.â Calling upon party members and the general public, Fakhrul said: âThere is great emotional excitement among us as our leader returns home. It is not just the BNPâpeople across the country are eager to welcome her. We urge our leaders and activists to maintain discipline and avoid causing traffic disruptions while lining the roads to receive her. We recommend welcoming her with the national flag in one hand and the party flag in the other.â âWe also ask the public to position themselves on the Elevated Expressway route from the airport to Kakoli, avoiding the surface roads to keep them clear,â he added. Praising Khaleda Ziaâs legacy, Fakhrul said: âAmong female leaders in Asia, Begum Khaleda Zia stands out as one of the most self-sacrificing and persecuted figures in the fight for democracy. She has never bowed to injustice or fascism. In 1971, when her husband, the martyred president Ziaur Rahman, declared the countryâs independence, she came to Dhaka with her two young sons, only to be arrested by Pakistani forces. ""She spent nine months in captivity inside a military cantonment. This courageous leader has never compromised on sovereignty or democracy.â He continued: ""Persecuted and imprisoned under false charges by the fascist Hasina regime, she later went to the UK for advanced treatment following a popular uprising. Few female leaders have shown such sacrifice. To us, she is not just a beloved figureâshe is a national treasure. ""She is the guiding light in our struggle for democracy, peopleâs rights, and the protection of independence.â",politics

In a parallel development, the UK BNP has announced plans for a significant farewell event for Khaleda Zia. The party's president and general secretary have issued a public appeal, urging all members, including leaders from the UK BNP and its affiliated organizations, to gather on Sunday afternoon at the road leading to the Royal Suite at Heathrow Airport. Earlier, on January 8, Khaleda Zia travelled to London for advanced medical treatment on a special air ambulance sent by the Emir of Qatar. Upon arrival, she was admitted to the London Clinic, where she received treatment under renowned specialists Professor Patrick Kennedy and Professor Jennifer Cross for 17 days. Since then, she has been receiving care at her son Tarique Rahmanâs residence. This time, after more than half a decade, Khaleda Zia celebrated Eid-ul-Fitr in London with her family.

Following that, the government made arrangements for her return via the Bangladesh High Commission in London and Doha. In 2018, BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia was imprisoned in Dhaka Central Jail following her conviction in a corruption case. She spent four Eids in jail and at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. On August 5, following a student and public uprising that led to the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government, President Md Shahabuddin issued an order granting her release. The court later annulled the verdicts in the two corruption cases in which she had been imprisoned.",politics

Fascism arises when the constitution and laws are ignored.â He continued: âFor this reason, we must ensure that no individual or groupâs hidden desire to extend power without election can tempt the state or government toward fascism.â He also said: âThatâs why it is essential to establish a government elected directly by the people, a representative national parliament, and an accountable administration.â Tarique also emphasized that an interim government cannot be an alternative to an elected one. âAfter a mass uprising or revolution that brings down a fascist or autocratic regime, a caretaker or interim government may be formed under special circumstances. Though not illegal, it can never be a substitute for a government elected by the people.â Earlier, the rally began at 2:10pm. From 10am, artists from JASAS performed songs.

In a message on the eve of May Day, he extended his heartfelt greetings to all workers at home and abroad who are working for family, society and above all for the development of the country, risking their lives. Tarique Rahman paid profound tributes to the memory of the workers who had made a supreme sacrifice in âHay Marketâ in Chicago, America, in 1886, while demanding the fair rights of workers, including an 8-hour workday, and who sacrificed themselves on the gallows for this movement. Referring to May Day as the celebration of the international labour movement, the BNP acting chairman said workers and labour organizations in different countries celebrate the day through processions and rallies on the streets. âFormer President Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Bir Uttam was a true worker, as he always felt proud to identify himself as a worker,â said Tarique Rahman, also the elder son ofÂ Ziaur Rahman and former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia.

On the day of its debut, NCP issued a declaration outlining the type of party it aspires to be and the ideologies it intends to follow. Two months on, the party is still in the process of drafting its constitution, with plans for a general meeting to verify and approve it. Member Secretary Akhtar Hossain, speaking to Dhaka Tribune on Tuesday, said: ""We have given a team the task of drafting the party constitution, but we will need a general meeting to verify and approve it. Overall, we need a little more time, but we are eager to publish it as soon as possible."" Initially, NCP leaders expressed a commitment to centrism, but over time, tensions have surfaced within the party due to the diverse ideological backgrounds within it. As a result, members with similar ideologies have developed a sense of kinship with other political parties that share their views. For example, those from Qawmi Madrasas have formed alliances with certain religious political parties, while those from leftist backgrounds have aligned themselves with left-wing parties. When asked about this issue, Akhtar Hossain said: ""The NCP is made up of people with various orientations, but everyone's main goal is to prioritize Bangladesh's interests. With that goal in mind, we are shaping our political stance. In reality, we've had very little time since our public emergence."" NCP leaders assert their belief in the political rights of people from different ideological backgrounds in Bangladesh and advocate for a political environment where all can coexist. Their current political agenda centers around calls for the trial of the Awami League, basic reforms, and a constituent assembly election before the general elections. NCP claims that those who support these demands have expressed their backing. NCP Joint Member Secretary Mushfiq Us Salehin told Dhaka Tribune: ""These reforms should be viewed from the perspective of restructuring the state's power structure rather than from a right-wing or left-wing viewpoint. We're eager to cooperate with everyone in this effort."" NCP Senior Joint Convener Ariful Islam Adib revealed that the party is working to finalize its manifesto, which will outline its slogan, goals, and motives. He emphasized that as a centrist party, NCP will have ideological differences with religion-based political parties. ""We will primarily focus on citizen rights, rather than the interests of religion-based parties,"" he said. NCP Joint Convener Anik Roy, who comes from a left-wing background, told Dhaka Tribune: ""Very soon, we will officially publish our declaration, manifesto, and additional literature. We believe this will clear up the current ambiguity."" In addition to working on the party constitution, NCP leaders and activists are actively involved in various activities, including regular campaigns against the Awami League at both the capital and district levels. The party is also holding ongoing meetings with various commissions, foreign diplomats, and other political parties. Moreover, NCP leaders have begun informal campaigning in their respective areas, following instructions from the partyâs top leaders, and are preparing to contest all 300 constituencies nationwide.

Such passages have been used to send aid to war-torn Gaza via Jordan. We do not want our country to become another Gaza.â He continued: âThe authoritarian Sheikh Hasina government gave shelter to over one million Rohingyas in the country but made no effort to repatriate them. Bangladesh is already facing such a complex situation.â âTaking such a major decision alone by the government is not right,"" said the BNP secretary general. ""This decision is linked to our independence, sovereignty, and the future peace and stability of this region. If this is requested by the United Nations, and if there is widespread public support for this initiative, the BNP will support any effort for world peace."" Regarding the upcoming election, Fakhrul said: ""The interim government has said that elections will be held between December and June. We want a clear roadmap for the elections."" He criticized the government for setting election and reform efforts against each other, saying: ""The BNPâs 31-point reform program outlines the most necessary reforms for the country."" Fakhrul also highlighted the centuries-old communal harmony in the country among Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, and Christians, which he claimed has been disrupted by the previous authoritarian government of Sheikh Hasina. He blamed Ramesh Sen, a member of the Awami League's central nomination committee, for instigating communal tensions in Thakurgaon, calling him one of the allies of the fallen autocratic regime. The BNP secretary general also said that, if the BNP comes to power, priority will be given to creating employment opportunities for the people.",politics

The Jubo Dal president said they plan to organize two-day programs in each division â a seminar on the first day, followed by a mass rally on the second day. He said theÂ seminars will focus on youth perspectives regarding employment, industrial development, education, healthcare, agriculture, environmental protection, and political rights â all with the goal of shaping a modern, humane, and inclusive Bangladesh.

He made these remarks on Sunday during a dialogue in the LD Hall of the parliament building, organized at the invitation of the National Consensus Commission. Zonayed Saki said: ""On issues where there are disagreements among stakeholders, we must go to the people, and that must be through an electoral process. Building national unity is a crucial task of the state.â He added: âWe hope that based on whatever consensus is reached through the discussions, it will be possible to move towards a democratic transformation and a new settlement.â He further said: âBut those who have sought to prolong their grip on power have used the state in every possible way. Sheikh Hasina, by almost pocketing the state machinery, turned Bangladesh into a fascist state."" Speaking on behalf of the Ganosamhati Andolon, Zonayed Saki said: ""The discussions held between the National Consensus Commission, political parties, and other stakeholders, and the resulting consensus, must be documented.â He added: âOn the reform proposals where consensus has not yet been established, further dialogue must continue to reach the highest possible level of consensus.

They called for constitutional reforms agreed upon in the charter to be implemented after the council election, while other reforms should be enacted through ordinances before the election. The meeting also stressed that any reform proposals for which a consensus cannot be achieved should be placed before the people through the election. Ganosamhati Andolon representatives called for ensuring maximum public involvement in the reform process through this method. During the discussions, it was mentioned that Ganosamhati Andolon had previously agreed to 138 proposals put forward by the National Consensus Commission, disagreed with 11, partially agreed with 13, and offered no opinion on four proposals.

He made the remark on Sunday afternoon after a meeting with the Bangladesh Jatiya Party (BJP) at the BNP chairpersonâs office in Gulshan. Khasru said: âWe are not heading towards a one-party system like Baksal in Bangladesh. Those who think that everyone must agree on everything have a Baksal mindset, similar to what Sheikh Hasinaâs father imposed. In a democratic country, differing opinions, distinct party philosophies, and diverse thoughts will always exist.â He further added: âWhere consensus has been reached, there is no scope for reforms beyond that. Any changes beyond the consensus must be made through the people's mandate, by participating in elections and through the democratic process.â The BNP leader alleged that even though a consensus has been achieved on various reform proposals, they have yet to be presented to the nation. Meanwhile, all parties have already submitted their proposals, considerable time has passed, and discussions have concluded, he added. He said: âIt does not take more than a week to determine consensus. The nation must be informed about where agreements have been reached. Based on that, a national charter should be signed, and the focus should shift towards elections. There is no scope to go beyond this.â Khasru also remarked that the failure to publish an electoral roadmap has created uncertainty and anxiety among the people, which could negatively impact the future electoral process. He said: âThe electoral roadmap must be announced as soon as possible to assure the nation that the country is moving toward democracy. Elections are the vehicle of democracy. Both domestic and international observers are eager to know when elections will be held in Bangladesh.â The meeting with the BJP was held at 4:30pm at the BNP chairpersonâs office in Gulshan.

Since April 17, BNP has been holding a series of meetings with its allied parties. A 10-member delegation from the BJP, led by Chairman Barrister Andaleeve Rahman Partho, attended the meeting. After the meeting, Partho said: âWhere consensus has been achieved regarding reforms, a national charter should be prepared based on that, and the country should move toward elections swiftly. Although 50 political parties might have differences on various issues, that should not be used as an excuse to delay elections or create confusion.â Answering a question, he said: âIt is possible to hold elections before December.

Kazi Salahuddin Ahmed's solo painting exhibition titled Debris opened at Alliance Francaise. Artist Monirul Islam was present at the ceremony as the chief guest. Moshiur Rahman, Managing Director of Paragon Group, and Mustafa Zaman, Director of the Department of Fine Arts, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, joined the occasion as special guests. The exhibition showcases almost 30 acrylic works on board paper, offering viewers a glimpse into the artistâs latest explorations. The artist Kazi Salahuddin Ahmed has lived through the 1971 war and, even today, continues to witness devastation in regions such as Syria, Russia, Kashmir, and Myanmarâdestruction that is entirely man-made. These tragedies, driven by the pursuit of power and control, have profoundly shaped his worldview. Over the decades, these experiences have left a lasting impression on his artistic journey, influencing both the themes and emotional depth of his work. Art critic Mustafa Zaman shared his impressions of the exhibition, âOf Real and Emotional Debris: The complete eraser of Gaza which was once full of life, the continued miseries of people in Kashmir, or the hopelessness faced by the displaced Rohingyas trying eke out a life in camps in Chattogram, all this jostle the mind as one tries hard to think of the future of the human race. It is also hard to leave behind the legacy of Bangladeshâs multiple failures in sculpting a future. Here the peopleâs dream for political stability has always remained a chimera. The fall of the repressive regime has certainly made way for all to focus on a future beyond the given structure, but it seems that things keep falling apart and we are only left with emotional debris. I navigate through a landscape where the edifices of our collective dream lie in ruin, hence the title âDebrisâ.â Kazi Salahuddin Ahmed is a highly accomplished artist who held his first exhibition in 1987. He has already participated in many group exhibitions and carried out around 30 solo exhibitions in Bangladesh and abroad, particularly in France, the United States,Â  India,Â  Pakistan,Â  the United Kingdom,Â  China,Â  Japan,Â  Australia,Â  Nepal,Â  Iran and in Yugoslavia.

Directed by renowned filmmaker Amitabh Reza Chowdhury, this comedy series features the acclaimed Mosharraf Karim in the lead role. He is joined by an ensemble of talented actresses including Tanzika Amin, Runa Khan, Moushumi Hamid, Sadia Ayman, Jui Karim, Farhana Hamid, Aditi and Brishti. From playing intense characters like OC Harun in Mohanagar to Mobarak in Mobaraknama, Mosharraf Karim has long captivated hoichoi audiences with his serious and layered portrayals. In Bohemian Ghora, he surprises viewers by stepping into the role of Abbas, a quirky truck driver- a complete departure from his usual screen presence. Speaking about his character, Mosharraf Karim said, âThis is my first large-scale collaboration with Amitabh Reza, and I was drawn to the story and the character from the start. Iâve had a long-standing relationship with hoichoi, and my expectations for this series are high. I believe audiences will find something truly fresh and entertaining in Bohemian Ghora.â 'Bohemian Ghora', a hoichoi Original, also features Runa Khan in a pivotal role. While she has appeared in several previous hoichoi titles, her character in this series stands out as bold, confident, and hot-tempered a striking contrast to her earlier roles. Tanzika Amin plays a character that is quite the opposite of her real-life persona. Mousumi Hamid will be seen as a female honey collector, while Sadia Ayman brings to life a spirited, energetic young woman. Jui Karim appears in a completely new light. Farhana Hamid, her performance brings quiet strength and subtle emotion, leaving a lasting impression, and the series also marks the debut of two new faces â Aditi and Brishti. Director Amitabh Reza Chowdhury brings his storytelling finesse to this project. Sharing his thoughts, he said, âBohemian Ghora tells the humorous yet complex tale of how Abbas juggles love, expectations, and suspicion â all while on a road full of adventures. Everyone who acted in this series is dear to me. It was a fantastic journey for all of us, and now weâre eagerly waiting to see how the hoichoi audience receives Bohemian Ghora.â",entertainment

The trailer of the series directed by Syed Ahmed Shawki was released on the night of May 8. We can see, the heirs get involved in various conflicts after the death of their father. Through such incidents the familyâs perfect image begins to crack. After 'Taqdeer' and 'Karagar', Shawki has moved forward with the story of a family in his third series, but he has kept conflict and mystery in it. Maruf Pratik is the writer of the story, dialogues, and screenplay of 'Gulmohor' along with the director. Why is the story of the family that the two have written together different from other family stories? Explaining that, Shawki said, 'Family crisis means division of property, quarrels among themselves, mistrust. My story has these. But what is more important or what I think makes this story different is the description of the dark side of the ancestors that the heirs have to carry.' Citing the examples of the series 'Taqdeer' and 'Karagar', Shawki said that he loves telling stories through the eyes of people who are outcasts from society. There is also a hint of this in the trailer of 'Gulmohar'. The series attempts to bring back a character and present social reality to the audience through his eyes. A rumor is doing the rounds on social media about the 'Gulmohar' series and Syed Ahmed Shawki. 'Gulmohar' is Shawki's largest-scale work as a director so far. The director has admitted the truth of this statement. But how can it be understood that it is a large-scale work? Explaining, Shawki said, ""In the case of fiction, large-scale work can depend on production design. 'Gulmohar' is such a fiction. However, when I say large-scale, I give the most importance to character design."" Shawki said, ""I have previously told the story of a single protagonist. But in the 'Gulmohar' series, there are many characters. Each character has different characteristics, different crises, different layers, different levels. It took a long time to write it, and the production design also had to be done on a large scale. So 'Gulmohar' is my largest-scale work."" Sara Zaker plays the role of Siraj's mother, and Intekhab Dinar, Sushama Sarkar, and Mir Naufel Ashrafi Jisan play the roles of siblings. Intekhab Dinar plays the role of the elder brother. He recently returned from abroad. Naturally, Intekhab Dinar's character goes through this personal family crisis. Sushama Sarkar plays the role of the sister, her character's name is Rehnuma. He said, ""'Gulmohar' is another addition to my acting career. Starting from the rehearsals, the entire process was great. Rehnuma or Renu is such a character that when you see her, you feel like she is a very familiar character, and then she becomes a little stranger somewhere. She repeatedly searches for the melody of her family relationship."" Mir Naufel Ashrafi Jisan played the role of Rabi. He said, ""Here, I feel like a family member with everyone else, that was my effort in acting and presence."" The character of Shanta, which is also a language, has been portrayed in the series. This character is played by Sarika Sabah. She said about her character, ""For this character, suffering is easy and love is a burden. I think many will see themselves in the character of Shanta."" Father, husband, son, brother and political leader - the character of Rana is played by Mostafizur Noor Imran. The actor said, ""This character has a legacy and tradition is very important to him. He is very reserved, does not share his thoughts or plans with others and ends up lost in his own thoughts."" Mostafizur Noor Imran said that one has to watch the series to know whether the character is good or bad. For Saswata Chatterjee, this is the first web series in Bangladesh.",entertainment

https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/380197/from-comilla-to-cannes,Haru's journey from Comilla to Cannes,"03 May 2025, 10:29 PM","Haru is helping the Bangladeshi film industry reach new heights Haru, a film student from SAFTI (Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute), is the editor of the short film ""A Doll Made Up Of Clay,"" which has been officially selected to compete at the Cannes Film Festival. From using art as a form of escapism to accomplishing his dreams, he is only at the beginning of his journey and has already done what others can only dream off. In an interview with Dhaka tribune, he helped us dive into in thoughts and talked about his dreams and experience. How did you get into filmmaking? In 2012, I got into college, Birshrestha Noor Mohammad Public College. My family shifted from Comilla to Dhaka at that time and I really couldn't match up with the Dhaka boys and wanted to find some form of art as a form of escapism. Reading books, writing stories, watching films and then altogether I got interested in writing film scripts. I started watching a lot of films via the suggestions of the film groups of Facebook such as 'Cinemakhor', 'Cinemakhorder adda' and by watching films I felt like I too can make films and then I wanted to study more about it. Then in 2015 I got into theÂ  Television and Film Studies of University of Dhaka and now I am here. Â  What is your prior experience in this field? In 2016 I started working as an AD for Sankha Dasgupta and Ahmed Hasan Sunny for a few days. They together had a production house back then, I am sorry I forgot the name of it. And then in 2018, I became an intern AD for Half Stop Down under the supervision of Amitabh Reza Chowdhury. I couldn't stay there for long either as my studies were hampering. I shot, edited and directed a film named 'MRP', which got selected at Nepal's Ekadeshma International Film Festival's 'Made in Bangladesh' corner. Among the 12 films that got selected, I was the youngest director at that time. The same film was selected at the International Film Festival of South Asia, Toronto, Canada in 2018. I made this film inside my own room at Dhaka, just by following my brother. The film cost was literally nothing. And after coming here in our first year, everyone has to direct at least one film, I too made one, which got selected at IIUSFF, Dhaka and later at Dhaka Intl. Film Festival, but I had to withdraw the selection as they needed Bangladesh Premiere status, which I didn't have as I already screened my film at IIUSFF, Dhaka. Â  How did SAFTI help you in this journey? SRFTI has a beautiful campus I must say. Kolkata already has a lot less noise than Dhaka and SRFTI campus have even lesser sound pollution. So it helps us to think about our stories and discuss among the people who come from different parts of the world. Even in India there are lots of languages among them. Hearing those languages, their stories sort of trigger our memories of similar sorts of stories which help us write better scripts I feel. Other than that, SRFTI has really good technical departments. Editing, Cinematography, Sound - these three departments are equipped with the best possible equipment along with the very talented teachers. As the teachers are already established filmmakers, this encourages us even more. Â  What does the Cannes selection mean for Bangladeshi films? I think all the film students, film enthusiasts who are a bit skeptical about if they should join the journey of filmmaking, this news should inspire and encourage them. I personally have been discouraged a lot for getting into filmmaking yet I stuck onto it hoping one day I might get success. I didn't keep myself occupied into the typical TVC syndicate area. I studied more, I continuously tried for more and eventually I got this. This took me a lot of patience, suffering, tolerating everyone else's comment but yeah, I was committed on my journey. Still a lot of journeys need to be covered. I am yet to work on a proper good feature film. I have my own stories to tell, so I am hoping to start on my feature film script as well, as soon as possible. Other than me, there are three more Bangladeshi students studying here in my batch, together I think we can help, encourage and inspire any newcomer who is passionate about filmmaking. Â  What advice would you give someone who wants to pursue this line of work? Keep patience and also there was a viral folk song which had two lines that's very much needed in this field. ""O manush, manush, tomar duto kana ar duto chokh. Dekhba ar shunba.Kintu ekta much toh, ektu kotha kom koba"" (translation: Oh human, human you have two ears and two eyes. You see and hear. But you have one mouth, you speak a little less."") Rather than talking a lot, people need to listen and observe more. Not just other people, knowing your own self is the hardest and most important to understand other's emotions. Only after that we can form our own stories. Other than that, it's not always needed to work with expensive film cameras, sound devices or editing software. Everyone has a smartphone these days, if someone wants to make a film, just take out your phone and start shooting like the way you always wanted to. Then try to make a narrative out of those footage in the editing table. And the sound too may follow or not follow the footage all the time. This should be the filmmaker's own creative choice. In our leisure time we have made films in this way and those too got selected into foreign film festivals. Obviously those are not something like Cannes, but we kept on our practices which eventually led us to the one from which we are getting the recognition, finally. With his wealth of knowledge and such nuanced perspective on the world, art creators like him give the future generations hope and drive. Itâs only a matter of time he reaches new heights.",entertainment

For some time now, Â Chorki has been planning to create opportunities for new and young filmmakers. The platform's CEO, Redoan Rony, said, ""Usually, it is seen that short films made by young people are focused on film festivals or have to be shown to a specific audience. After that, there is no way to show or watch them. Chorki's initiative is to create that opportunity."" Chorki's Lead Business and Growth Faisal Rahman confirmed that this effort will continue with young producers and artists. He said, ""In addition to encouraging the youth and recognizing their work, we want to create new audiences."" Chorki's Creative Producer Al-Amin Hasan Nirjhar said that they have selected 5 short films with different stories and production styles from many short films.

I respect this initiative of Chorki. It will inspire many new filmmakers like me to do great work.' The short film 'Subrata Sengupta' is based on the screenplay of the late filmmaker Tarek Masud. Director Abir Ferdous Mukhar said, 'I was fortunate to work at the Tarek Masud Memorial Trust for a few days. That's where I first came across this screenplay. We started this work with the permission of Catherine Masud. We have added our own ideas while maintaining the atmosphere of the original script.' This short film gradually reveals how various factors such as family, society, love, religion, and politics influenced Subrata Sengupta's life in the late nineties. 'The Sky Gets Gloomy at Night' is a short drama . Its director Mahmudul Hasan Adnan said, ""After almost three years of making, my work 'The Sky Gloomy at Night' is going to reach everyone through Chorki. Which is a moment of great joy for me. I hope that the release of my film will lead me to the next film."" Due to unwanted mistakes and betrayals, a cruel reality descends on Beaver's personal, family and social life. From there, âEevival' is made about the story of starting over. Its director Mahmud Hasan said, 'I feel quite confident in giving Chorki the responsibility of showing the face of my first child in front of the audience.' The story of 'The Home in Sound' is built on the difficult struggle between friendship and dreams and reality. Its director Fuad said, ""Our journey is mainly in the coastal region where we wanted to say, the sea that saves our lives, the sea that consumes our lives. Our film was released on Chorki and I think Chorki is going to start a new journey for short films in Bangladesh.""",entertainment

Survival through teamwork: It's a tale as old as time with particular resonance today, says Argentine actor Ricardo Darin of his latest project ""The Eternaut,"" which hit Netflix on Wednesday. Â  Based on a 1950s comic with iconic status in the South American country, the sci-fi series tells the story of a mysterious, toxic snowfall that precedes an alien invasion of Buenos Aires. Â  More elementally, it is about ordinary people with few resources and no special powers who collectively stare down a totalitarian threat, Darin, 68, told AFP in an interview. Â  ""The communities that managed to survive were those that stood shoulder to shoulder, defended themselves, and did not care only about what happened to them individually,"" he said of the storyline. Â  In this way, the series ""resonates"" with the present, said Darin, though he declined to specify which threat in particular he was referring to. Â  Directed and scripted by Argentina's Bruno Stagnaro, ""The Eternaut"" is based on the comic by the same name serialized by writer Hector Oesterheld and illustrator Francisco Solano Lopez between 1957 and 1959. Â  Oesterheld took the series up again in the 1960s, with ever-more political overtones that are believed to have contributed to his kidnapping in 1977 under Argentina's brutal military dictatorship. Â  He was never heard from again, nor were his four daughters and three sons-in-law, all of whom figure among the estimated 30,000 people listed as ""disappeared"" by agents of the dictatorship, according to rights groups. Â  - 'Very, very hard work' - Darin, known for his roles in the films ""Nine Queens,"" ""Wild Tales,"" and ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" -- which won the Oscar for best international feature in 2010 -- said he was scared at first of playing Juan Salvo, the resistance hero in ""The Eternaut."" Â  He had no background in science fiction and had to do demanding stunts. Â  ""Physically it was very, very hard work,"" the actor said. Â  ""Each day, the end of filming found us exhausted, and with little recovery time."" Â  Darin took part in 113 of the 148 days of shooting, often decked out in Salvo's heavy snow-proof outfit on sets covered with tons of cumbersome artificial snow. Â  ""Not to mention the things that happen in an action shoot, where you have to roll, jump, fall, crash, fight; a series of things that when you're 25 or 30 years old, it's nothing, but for me, who is 114..."" he laughed. Â  Darin is hopeful the series will be a boost for Argentine cinema at a time the government of budget-slashing President Javier Milei has withdrawn state support for the National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts, and for culture in general. Â  ""Nothing like this has ever been done here,"" said Darin of the project.",entertainment

The win also marked the filmâs European premiere, making a significant statement on the global stage about Bangladeshâs ongoing human rights concerns. Director Shah Newaz Khan Cju, who traveled to Prague to accept the award, shared his excitement in a press statement from Berlin, where he is currently based. âThis is my first major international award, and honestly, Iâm still in disbelief. Itâs a matter of immense pride to bring this honor home from Kafkaâs city,â he said. He further added, ""One of the jury members shared something that touched me deeply â Not a Fiction was competing head-to-head with another highly talked-about European film, which had a production budget of around 50,000 Euros. Despite that, they awarded our film â made with less than 100 Euros â purely based on the strength of its story and execution. Big-budget films are common, but a work like Not a Fiction comes only once in a while, and they wanted to honor that rarity.â Cju also announced that Not a Fiction is set for an online release within the next month, giving audiences in Bangladesh and around the world the opportunity to experience the film firsthand. Not a Fiction is co-produced by renowned film critic and journalist Sadia Khalid Reeti and Laily Begum. The story and screenplay are penned by Mokarram Rana. The cast includes Udoyon Rajib, Naimul Alam Mishu, Oishik Sami Ahmed, Rudroneel Ahmed, Jawad Saudho, and Mithun. Voice performances were provided by Ahsan Shoron and Syed Tamur Hasan. The filmâs executive production was led by Md. Asif, with sound design by Ripon Nath and Rony Sazzad, color grading by Rashaduzzaman Sohag, and editing by Leon Rozario and Tanvir Ahmed Rony. Assistant directors Md. Aman Khan and Al Amin Sumon also contributed significantly to the production. With its latest accolade, Not a Fiction solidifies its place as one of Bangladeshâs most important short films in recent memory, blending artistic excellence with urgent social commentary",entertainment

In its 47th edition, Bangladeshi film âMastulâ has received widespread praise and the Special Mention (Jury) award. On Tuesday, âMastulâ had its world premiere in Moscow, where both international film critics and general audiences were present. The filmâs premiere was attended by the director Mohammad Nuruzzaman, cinematographer Mohammad Arifuzzaman, and the two lead actors, Fazlur Rahman Babu and Deepak Suman. After the screening, the Mastul team was showered with congratulations and best wishes from the audience. Later, film critics and discerning viewers asked insightful questions about various aspects of the film. For several years now, Bangladeshi films, including Adim and Nirvana, have regularly featured in the main competition section of the Moscow Film Festival. However, the team behind Mastul expressed that the overwhelming response they received from the Moscow audience on Tuesday night was the greatest reward. The lead actors, Fazlur Rahman Babu and Deepak Suman, were deeply moved by the love shown by the audience and critics alike. Babu expressed his feeling of being âfortunateâ to attend the festival, saying, âAttending such a grand festival in Moscow is a privilege for anyone, and I feel lucky to be here with the film I acted in. I also consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to be a part of this film.â The veteran actor further commented, âGetting a spot in Moscow's main competition section is a matter of great pride not just for the Mastul team but also for Bangladesh and independent filmmakers.â Actor Deepak Suman, too, expressed his excitement, saying, âItâs a great honor for me to be here in Moscow thanks to Mastul. The reaction from the audience at the premiere was beyond my expectations.â He added, âThe audience observed everything so perfectly that one foreign viewer even asked me if I really work on a ship! The way the audience and critics responded to the film is definitely a major achievement for me.â Cinematographer Arifuzzaman was equally astonished by the keen observation of the audience. He said, âIn Moscow, I noticed that everyone watches the film with great attention. I realized this during the âMeet the Pressâ event, where journalists and critics asked so many detailed questions about Mastul. The fact that they paid such attention to every little detail is something I consider a significant achievement.â Since arriving in Moscow on April 21, director Mohammad Nuruzzaman has been engaging with the festival organizers, giving interviews, and answering questions from journalists and the audience after the filmâs premiere. Previously, he had attended the festival with the film Adim as a co-producer, but this time heâs there with his own directed film, which has made the experience even more special. Nuruzzaman expressed his satisfaction with the festivalâs projection system: âThe screens were so impressive, and the sound delivery during the Mastul premiere was exactly as I had hoped. Having worked on the sound in South India for this film, seeing it presented so perfectly in Moscow was incredibly satisfying.â At the premiere in Moscow, not only foreign viewers but also many expatriate Bangladeshis attended. After watching the film, they remarked that Mastul, with its cultural diversity, human emotions, and reflection of reality, was able to win the hearts of Moscowâs audience. Moscow critics praised Mastul for its story, direction, and performances. Many viewers noted that the film is not just the story of one country but a universal human language that can touch people from any culture. Critics also praised the cinematography, music, and dialogues, which won over the hearts of Moscowâs film buffs. This achievement is not just for Mastul but also for the entire Bangladeshi film industry, marking a significant moment for the countryâs cinema. The enthusiastic response from Moscow proves that with a good story and skilled filmmaking, language or geographic boundaries are not obstacles. Mastul has crossed those boundaries and is now representing Bangladeshâs culture on the world stage. The awards were announced on April 24. The Mastul team is expected to return to Dhaka on April 26, provided everything goes as planned. The film Mastul, which is based on the story of sailors floating on the water, also features performances by Aminur Rahman Mukul, Arif Hasan, Sifat Bonya, and others. The digital distribution and promotion of the film are handled by Tonghor Taklies.",entertainment

That day, at 8:45 am, the building named Rana Plaza collapsed in Savar, Dhaka. In this accident, 1,175 garment workers who were there were killed and more than two thousand people were injured. Like everyone else, director Kamar Ahmad Simon was tormented by the incident. The fast-paced life of people makes many catastrophies forgettable like turning the pages of a newspaper. Still, some incidents, haunt them for a long time. Kamar Ahmad Simon had been feeling that torment since the incident. After the Rana Plaza tragedy, he could not sit still and made âTestimony of a Threadâ in 2015. According to the director, âI made the film at the expense of a citizenâ. Over a decade after the Rana Plaza tragedy, âTestimony of a Threadâ will be released on Chorki on April 24. Viewers can watch âTestimony of a Threadâ on the OTT platform for free.Â  Kamar Ahmad Simon wanted to make a feature film about Rana Plaza. âTestimony of a Threadâ was made from his research material. Inspired by Akira Kurosawaâs âRashomonâ, âTestimony of a Threadâ is a 52-minute film. A monologue collage in an attempt to find the human face behind the most serious structural failure in modern history. Regarding the release of this film in Chorki, Kamar said, ""There are mixed feelings. Since Chorki is currently one of the main streaming platforms in the Bengali language, there is no better way to reach the Bengali-speaking audience at home and abroad. But at the same time, as a director, I also have a claim, the way the film is being celebrated around the world right nowâit seems that the audience is not being treated fairly. Also, since my film 'Another Day...' is coming up, I want to see how the audience of Chorki receives a demanding film like 'Testimony of a threadâ.â ' Testimony of a threadâ won the Asian Pitch Award in 2013. 'Monologue Collage', written and directed by Kamar Ahmad Simon, was produced by Sara Afreen. The film, by the production company Shuchan, was jointly produced by four of Asia's leading television networks â NHK (Japan), KBS (South Korea) , PTS (Taiwan) and Â Mediacorp (Singapore).",entertainment

On Tuesday (April 22), the victim Pinky Akhter filed the case in the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Nazmin Akhter. The court took the plaintiff's statement, investigated the case and ordered the Police Bureau of Investigation (PBI) to submit a report by May 8. Plaintiff's lawyer Nasidus Zaman Nishan confirmed this information. A person named Sourav (28), who lives in the same flat with Pori Moni, has also been made an accused in the case. According to the charges in the case, Pinky took a job at the defendants' house through an organization called Quader Agency in March 2024. Before being hired, Pinky was supposed to take care of one child, but she had to take care of two children. She was also made to do the cooking at home at different times of the day and night. Since the job was absolutely necessary, the plaintiff was carrying out her duties with sincerity, accepting everything. However, on April 2 of this year at 1 pm, the accused Pori Moni came intoxicated from her makeup room to the child's room and started abusing Pinky in foul language. When asked about the reason for the abuse, Pori Moni said, ""Why are you making milk for my child, now you will give them solid food."" Pinky said, ""According to the child's eating routine, now they are supposed to be fed milk, so I made milk."" At that time, Pori Moni got angry and slapped the plaintiff indiscriminately on the head, face and eyes. At one stage, Pinky became unconscious. After regaining consciousness, she was terrified. In order to get to a safe place from the scene, the victim Pinky kept requesting Pori Moni to take her to the hospital. Accused No. 2 Sourav was present at the time of the incident. But the accused did not listen to her. In addition, accused Sourav encouraged Pori Moni to torture Pinky and prevented her from leaving the house. Later, Pinky called 999 and went to safety from the scene with the help of the police. She sought treatment at Kurmitola General Hospital in Dhaka. In this incident, the victim Pinky Akhter filed a general diary with Bhatara Police Station on April 4. Later, not seeing any progress in it, she filed a case in the court, which is also mentioned in the statement.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/379144/from-bangladesh-to-the-world-the-evolution-of,From Bangladesh to the world: The evolution of music releases,"21 Apr 2025, 03:59 PM","Much like global counterparts in the indie scenes of India, Nigeria or South Korea, Bangladeshi musicians now manage their own releases, coordinate with digital distributors and cultivate global audiences. In the 1990s and early 2000s, during the major religious festival of Eid in Bangladesh, a visit to any neighborhood market would reveal a vibrant cultural tradition: loudspeakers blasting newly released songs, children humming along and cassette or CD stalls crowded with eager buyers. Music was not just entertainment; it was a seasonal event, a communal expression of joy and celebration. Eid was the prime occasion for releasing new songs, and in many ways, it mirrored the global phenomenon of timed music dropsâwhether it was Christmas albums in the West or Diwali releases in India.Today, that scene is a memory.The gradual disappearance of Eid-specific music releases in Bangladesh isnât just about nostalgiaâitâs a reflection of how deeply the global music industryâs transformation has affected local markets. The journey of Bangladeshi musicâfrom cassettes to CDs, from radio to YouTube and now, from a domestic ritual to a digital global phenomenonâcaptures the profound shifts in music distribution and cultural consumption in the 21st century.The Cassette Boom: Bangladesh Joins the Global Tape CultureThe story of Bangladeshâs music industry as a commercial entity begins in 1982 with the release of the country's first audio cassette by Disco Recording. This mirrored a broader trend across Asia and Africa, where cassettes democratized music. Much like in Egypt, Nigeria and India, the cassette tape in Bangladesh empowered local musicians and regional languages, bringing music out of elite or state-controlled spaces and into peopleâs homes.In the ensuing years, artists like Kumar Bishwajit, M.A. Shoaeb, Runa Laila and Andrew Kishore began releasing non-film music, carving out a parallel ecosystem alongside the already vibrant world of film songs. Bands emerged. Labels flourished. An audio economy was born.By the 1990s, Bangladesh had its own bustling music industry that resembled the pop and rock booms of the UK in the '70s and '80sâonly with Bengali lyrics, regional roots and unique melodic signatures.The Rise of Bands and Mixed Albums: Local Innovation, Global InfluenceThe 1990s marked the golden age of Bangladeshi pop and rock, with bands like LRB, Miles, Feedback and Warfaze leading a cultural revolution. They were Bangladeshâs answer to Pink Floyd, Guns Nâ Roses and Queenânot in imitation, but in impact. LRBâs Ferari Mon (1996) or Milesâs Prottasha (1993) were not just chart-toppers; they were cultural landmarks, shaping youth identity and musical taste.Meanwhile, the concept of the âmixed albumââa compilation featuring multiple artists and composersâbecame a Bangladeshi innovation that drove market demand. Producers like Prince Mahmud turned these albums into blockbusters. This format, though similar in spirit to the Western âsoundtrack album,â was unique in its structure and local appeal.CD, Piracy, and the Digital CliffAs in much of the world, the early 2000s ushered in a rapid shift from analog to digital. CDs replace cassettes, but not for long. The onset of MP3 piracy, mobile phone ringtones, and file-sharing platforms disrupted the market just as it had in North America and Europeâonly without the cushion of robust copyright enforcement or diversified revenue streams.While giants like iTunes and Spotify began consolidating the global digital music economy, Bangladesh's music industry was left vulnerable. By 2010, most local audio labels had either shuttered or pivoted entirely to survive.Yet, amidst this disruption, creativity flourished. Artists like Habib Wahid and Fuad Al Muqtadir brought in a new soundâinfusing traditional melodies with modern electronic beats, a style that resonated with the Bangladeshi diaspora and global listeners alike.FM Radio and the DIY GenerationFrom 2007 to 2012, FM radio brought a renaissance, similar to the way college radio and indie stations shaped the alt-rock scene in the U.S. in the â90s. New voicesâTopu, Minar, Hridoy Khanâfound audiences, while bands like Artcell, Black, and Shironamhin cultivated loyal fanbases, much like indie rock bands in Seattle or Manchester once did.By the mid-2010s, Bangladeshâs artists, much like their counterparts across Latin America or Eastern Europe, began bypassing labels altogetherâembracing YouTube, Facebook and later, Spotify and Apple Music. Suddenly, the potential audience was no longer confined to Dhaka or Chattogram, but expanded to Bengali-speaking listeners in New York, London, Toronto and Sydney.A Streaming Story in Two RealitiesWhen Spotify finally launched in Bangladesh in 2021, it was a symbolic moment. Bangladeshi artists could now release their songs directly to the world. But the domestic music economy had already changed. The failure of local music streaming apps like GP Music and Robi Splash highlighted a stark reality: while the global infrastructure was now in place, local monetization remained a challenge.And yet, paradoxically, Bangladeshi music now travels farther than ever before.Independent artists and bandsâfrom Pritom Hasan and Masha to Ashes and Bangla Fiveâare gaining international visibility. Just as K-pop, Afrobeat and Punjabi hip-hop have leapt across linguistic and geographic boundaries, Bangla music too is finding its niche. Songs by Bangladeshi artists are being used in short films, remixes and reels by content creators across the globe.This is perhaps the most fascinating twist in the tale: even as the local infrastructure collapses, global platforms offer new lifelines.The New Global-Local ParadigmIn todayâs Bangladesh, the business model of music has changed. The big labels now focus more on YouTube dramas and video content, using songs as marketing tools rather than cultural products. But this shift mirrors broader global trends, where music is often a complement to larger digital ecosystemsâused to enhance branding, build followers and attract streams.Meanwhile, artists have turned into entrepreneurs. Much like global counterparts in the indie scenes of India, Nigeria or South Korea, Bangladeshi musicians now manage their own releases, coordinate with digital distributors and cultivate global audiences.A Festival Without Songs?It is in this context that Eidâs musical silence becomes poignant. The festival, once synonymous with new music, now passes with only a handful of releases. Not because the artists have stopped creatingâbut because the infrastructure has changed. The neighborhood record shop is gone. The cassette is extinct. The local CD player was replaced by smartphones that connect to the world.And yet, thereâs hope.In the quiet, a new kind of music is emergingâborderless, hybrid, and personal. Itâs being recorded in bedrooms, produced on laptops, and released on streaming platforms that know no national boundaries.From Bangladesh to the world, the song goes on.

Â  The ""Firework"" and ""California Gurls"" singer was lofted more than 60 miles (100 kilometers) above the Earth's surface in a vessel from Blue Origin, the space company owned by the Amazon founder. Â  Five other women -- including Bezos's fiancee Lauren Sanchez -- were on the flight, which took off from western Texas shortly after 8:30 am (1330 GMT) before safely landing again some 10 minutes later. Â  The flight brought the passengers beyond the Karman line -- the internationally recognized boundary of space. Â  One of the other passengers, TV presenter Gayle King, said Perry sang ""What a wonderful world"" in space. Â  ""It's a 10 out of 10. That's my review.

Â  Their fully automated craft rose vertically before the crew capsule detached mid-flight, later falling back to the ground slowed by parachutes and a retro rocket. Â  The jubilant women then emerged, with Perry kissing the ground after exiting the capsule. Â  ""I think this experience has shown me you never know how much love is inside of you, like how much love you have to give and how loved you are until the day you launch,"" she said. Â  Monday's mission was the first all-woman space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963. Â  It is also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered space tourism experiences for several years. Â  The company does not publicly communicate the price of trips made possible by its New Shepard rocket. Â  They were expected to have a brief period when the women could unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity. Â  - 'Inspiration' - Perry, launched onto the international stage with her 2008 hit ""I Kissed a Girl,"" was also travelling alongside Sanchez, King, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA scientist Aisha Bowe and Amanda Nguyen, founder of a campaign group against sexual violence. Â  They follow 52 previous Blue Origin passengers, including longtime ""Star Trek"" leading man William Shatner. Â  King's close friend -- talk show legend Oprah Winfrey -- was among those watching the launch in Texas. Â  ""It's oddly quiet when you get up there... you look down at the planet and think, 'That's where we came from?' And to me it's such a reminder about how we need to do better and be better,"" King said. Â  Perry recently told Elle magazine that she was taking part ""for my daughter Daisy,"" whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, ""to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams."" Â  Such high-profile guests are intended to keep public interest in Blue Origin's work, as it battles multiple rival firms in the space tourism field. Â  Bezos' top challenger in passenger flights is Virgin Galactic, which offers a similar sub-orbital experience. Â  But Blue Origin aims in the future to bring space tourists into orbit, competing directly with Elon Musk's SpaceX. Â  In January, Blue Origin's much more powerful New Glenn rocket successfully completed its first unmanned orbital mission.",entertainment

That total for the film, made along with Legendary Pictures and starring Jack Black, Jason Momoa and Jennifer Coolidge, far surpassed expectations, making it the year's biggest domestic release. It was also the most successful adaptation ever from a video game, bettering the $146 million opening of 2023's ""Super Mario Bros. Movie.""

He said the film had remarkable cross-generation appeal and that while reviews were ""not good, these pictures are made for moviegoers, not critics.""

Â  Directed by Mehedi Hasan Hridoy, âBorbaadâ has taken the lead among this yearâs other major Eid releases â Afran Nisho starter 'Daagi', Siam Ahmed starrer 'Jongli', Mosharraf Karim starrer 'Chokkor 302', and Sajal-Nusraat Fariaâs 'Jinn-3' â earning Tk 28.82 lakh alone on its opening day, according to the Facebook-based movie enthusiast page BMR â Bangla Movie Review.

Â  Initially scheduled for two daily screenings at the Bashundhara City and Sony Square branches of Star Cineplex until April 3, the film was dropped a day early due to poor audience turnout. Â  Starring Shakib Khan alongside Kolkata actress Darshana Banik, âAntorattaâ had originally been slated for release in 2022 but faced delays. Its low-key promotional campaign, coupled with minimal involvement from the cast, contributed to its lacklustre performance. Â  Following its removal from Star Cineplex, the film had two screenings at Lion Cinemas on Tuesday and is still showing at Blockbusters Cinemas in Jamuna Future Park. However, its total multiplex earnings over two days amounted to just Tk 1.27 lakh.

Based on Simon Stalenhagâs graphic novel, it had all the ingredients for something groundbreaking. But the film struggles to connect on a deeper level.

Along the way, they cross paths with Keats (Chris Pratt), a small-time smuggler, and his robotic companion, Herman (Anthony Mackie). As they dig deeper, they uncover a connection between Christopherâs disappearance and Sentre, a dominant tech corporation run by the shrewd Ethan Skate. His revolutionary technology played a key role in humanityâs victory against the robots, leading to their exile in the exclusion zone. With Keats and the stranded robots as allies, Michelle takes on Ethanâs powerful empire to bring her brother home. The Electric State aimed to blend emotion with world-building in a way that could redefine sci-fi storytelling. Instead, Netflix delivered a movie that split audiencesâsome praising its artistry, others frustrated by its lack of depth. The blend of retro-futuristic technology with desolation makes for an arresting cinematic experience. But thatâs where the unanimous praise ends. Where The Electric State falters is in its emotional depth. The relationship between the people and robots, which should have been the heart of the film, feels distant and underwritten. There are moments of brillianceâfleeting glimpses of the deeper, more poignant story that could have beenâbut they are drowned out by a script that never quite finds its footing. The pacing drags and the emotional beats never fully land. What should have been a deeply affecting odyssey often feels more like a slow, scenic detour with no clear destination. One of the most frustrating aspects of The Electric State is how close it came to greatness. The pieces were all thereâan evocative world, a strong conceptual foundation, and an atmosphere thick with the weight of forgotten memories. And yet, the film feels strangely passive. It is something to watch, not something to feel.",entertainment

Dhallywood actress Afia Nusrat Barsha recently announced her decision to quit acting, after returning from performing Umrah. She made the announcement at a press conference on Thursday (Mar 20), where her husband and co-actor Ananta Jalil was also present. Barsha clarified that she will complete her ongoing film projects before retiring from acting. âI still have a few films in hand, which will take some time to complete. But after that, I will not work in any new films,â she said at the press conference. Elaborating about the reason behind her decision, she explained, âI am a very realistic person. I believe actresses look good on screen only up to a certain age, and they should work within that limit; so I have decided to step away from films on my own.â Barsha also mentioned her children as a key factor in her decision. âMy eldest son is now 10 years old, and my youngest is 7. In a few years, when my eldest is 14 or 15, how will he feel knowing his mother is a film actress? Keeping that in mind, I made this decision.â Her husband, Ananta Jalil, has no objections to her decision. ""Barsha is still younger than many leading actresses in our industry: yet, she has chosen to step away on her own,"" he said at the press conference. Barsha made her big-screen debut in 2010 with the film 'Khoj: The Search'. She gained popularity by starring in multiple films opposite his husband, Ananta Jalil. The couple got married on September 23, 2011, and they have two sons - Ariz Ibn Jalil and Abrar Ibn Jalil. With this decision, Barsha is set to end her long career in the film industry. It remains to be seen whether she will stay entirely away from showbiz or remain involved in some other capacity.",entertainment

https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/376255/a-bittersweet-memoir-we-live-in-time,We Live in Time: A bittersweet memoir,"14 Mar 2025, 01:40 PM","At its core, this film serves as a reminder to cherish the little moments and appreciate the people in our lives Helmed by John Crowley, We Live in Time (2024) is a film that gracefully intertwines elements of melodrama with the essence of a romantic comedy. With two brilliant actorsâAndrew Garfield and Florence Pugh, this film initially presents itself as a lighthearted love story. However, beneath its seemingly simple exterior lies a deeply moving narrative that delves into the complexities of love, loss, and the weight of time. Florence Pugh plays Almut, a chef at a restaurant, while Andrew Garfield portrays Tobias, a representative at a food company. Together, they navigate the joys of life and parenthood while raising their daughter, Ella. Nevertheless, the film takes a poignant turn when Almut is diagnosed with Stage 3 ovarian cancer, forcing them to confront the harsh realities of time slipping away. While We Live in Time fits within the rom-com genre, it stands apart by weaving in profound themes that go beyond the usual lighthearted tropes. The film doesnât shy away from tackling difficult subjectsâterminal illness, the decision of whether or not to have children, and the emotional burden of watching a loved one fade away. One of the most striking aspects of the film is how it realistically captures emotions. The dialogues are simple yet powerful, allowing the audience to connect deeply with the charactersâ experiences. The performances by Garfield and Pugh are particularly commendable, as they bring raw authenticity to every scene. For anyone who has lost a loved one to cancer, the film is especially moving. It serves as a reminder to cherish the little moments and appreciate the people in our lives. Through Almut and Tobias, the film paints a picture of a couple who, despite the impending loss, choose to find beauty in their time together rather than succumb to despair. A notable strength of We Live in Time is its depiction of a mature relationship based on communication and mutual support. Almut and Tobias do not let their struggles drive them apart, instead, they confront each challenge together. Whether itâs dealing with the stress of Almutâs diagnosis or making life-altering decisions, they engage in honest conversationsâsomething that is rarely portrayed in films today. Their dynamic is a refreshing take on modern relationships, emphasizing that love is not just about romance but also about standing by one another in the toughest times. At the heart of the film is the idea of living in the moment. Almut is given the option to undergo surgery for her tumor, but with no guarantee that it will prevent the cancer from spreading or ultimately leading to her demise. Despite this, she chooses to forgo the procedure. She decides to spend quality time with her family, making the most of the time she has left. As a chef, cooking is the one thing Almut can still control. She pours all her energy into perfecting her craft, ultimately earning a place in the prestigious Bocuse d'Orâthe Olympics of the culinary world. However, fate presents her with a difficult choiceâthe competition falls on the same day as her wedding. With only a limited amount of time left, she must decide between chasing her professional dream or spending one of her final days celebrating her love with Tobias and Ella. Almutâs struggle is a reflection of what countless women experienceâwanting to build a meaningful career while also being present for their loved ones. Her choice to pursue the competition highlights her determination to leave behind a legacy beyond being a wife and mother. She refuses to let her illness define her existence and instead chooses to be remembered for her strength, ambition, and passion. The film employs a non-linear storytelling approach, reflecting the unpredictable nature of life and love, while adding a layer of realism that mirrors the fragmented nature of human memory and experience. The structure of the film, which shifts between different points in time, reflects the experience of life flashing before oneâs eyes. The first 10-15 minutes may seem disjointed, but as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that this technique serves a greater purposeâcapturing the essence of time and how we live within it. We Live in Time takes audiences on an emotional journey through the highs and lows of love and loss, reminding us to appreciate the beauty in everyday life.",entertainment

https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/375978/nadaaniyan-and-the-death-of-rom-coms,Nadaaniyan and the death of rom-coms,"11 Mar 2025, 02:29 PM","Khushi and Ibrahimâs acting was a trainwreck, but the real villains are the writers and directors who botched the execution of the entire project I watched Nadaaniyan immediately after it dropped on Netflix a few days ago, and I knew I was walking into a mess, but hey, at least I thought I'd get some mindless entertainment out of it. It turned out to be way worse than that.Â  Letâs get one thing straight: itâs not just the nepo kidsâ fault here. We canât just blame Khushi Kapoor and Ibrahim Ali Khan for this hot mess. The real villain is the appalling execution of the entire project. Did the writers even use more than two brain cells to cook this? Itâs hard to believe otherwise. More compelling plots have emerged in peopleâs late-night, sleep-deprived daydreams. The whole ""fake boyfriend"" trope has been done before and done well! To All the Boys Iâve Loved Before is proof that this tired cliche can still slap when executed right. But Nadaaniyan? It takes this trope, throws it headfirst into a brick wall, and calls it a day. It doesn't just fail to capture its audience; it doesn't even try. The storyline (if we can even call it that) revolves around Pia and Arjun. These characters could not be more two-dimensional. Pia is a cardboard cutout of a rich girl with daddy issues. Arjun, on the other hand, is supposedly ""intelligent,"" but nothing on screen suggests heâs capable of stringing together a coherent thought. Apparently we're supposed to believe he's a genius just because he has abs. Together, they create something that cannot be called chemistry, that definitely transcends cringe. For whatever reason, Khushi and Ibrahimâs voices were dubbed, evidently out of sync. Itâs 2025, and if a team cannot sync audios properly, itâs simply just lazy work. The entire production (from the plot to the camerawork) was like watching a slow-motion car crash. Painful and impossible to look away from. Which brings me to the burning question: What happened to good rom-coms? When we were growing up, Bollywood served us Jab We Met and Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na; actual rom-com royalty! Now? Either I am too old, or the genre has headed straight into the abyss of mediocrity. jwARI.fetch( $( ""#ari-image-jw682970c31dc91"" ) ); Netflixâs Mismatched (which they try to brand as ""funny"" and ""charming"") managed to keep me hooked for three seasons. Was it great? No. Was it guilty pleasure trash I couldn't stop watching? Absolutely. But one has to admit that Mismatched was a misstep. Take Anmol and Vinny, or Sid and Zeenat - great stories, totally overshadowed by Rishi and Dimple, the main characters who have about as much on-screen chemistry as two damp towels, which is ironic considering their off-screen dynamic is supposedly electric. Their on-again, off-again relationship is so insufferable, itâs like even the audience is ready to give up. And itâs not just Bollywood suffering from this rom-com curse. Western shows and movies are no better. XO, Kitty (a spin-off of To All The Boys, which was arguably one of the best rom-coms in recent memory) feels like its own unique brand of chaos. The whole first season was so ridiculously bad that I found myself laughing through most of it.Â  Honestly, Iâve never seen anyone as indecisive as Kitty. She switched romantic interests faster than we swapped out outfits. What happened to the sassy, self-assured Kitty we all fell in love with from Lara Jeanâs story? Gone. Vanished. Sheâs a completely different person here, with horrible acting as well by the way.Â  jwARI.fetch( $( ""#ari-image-jw682970c31dcb3"" ) ); The list of Netflix rom-com flops is so long. The Perfect Date, The Kissing Booth, Sierra Burgess Is a Loser, Holidate - each one a new level of disappointment. Itâs like rom-com creators are playing a sick game of âhow low can we go?â Every story follows the same tired formula: a ""meet cute"" that isn't cute, followed by unnecessary melodrama. What we need are fresh narratives, not the same old tropes like the fake boyfriend or manic pixie dream girl. Also, the superficial relationships weâre forced to endure. Itâs like rom-com writers have a personal vendetta against letting their characters actually bond. Can we, for once, let the main characters talk to each other? The creators also seem to think that tossing in a few Gen Z buzzwords like 'slay' or 'rizz' makes them instantly relatable. Spoiler: it doesnât. Weâre more than just a checklist of internet trends and slapstick jokes. How about bringing back the smart, subtle humor that made the genre feel authentic instead of treating us like we only speak in memes.Â  And where are the good characters? Geet from Jab We Met is still iconic because she was unapologetically herself, even within the manic pixie dream girl trope. We need more characters who feel real, relatable, and human. Instead, we get cardboard cutouts who are so forgettable I can barely recall their names after the credits roll.Â  Coming back to Nadaaniyan: Sure, Khushi and Ibrahim's acting was a disaster, but Iâm not holding it against them. After all, even Alia Bhatt had a cringe-worthy start in Student of the Year, but now she has truly grown as an artist. My real beef is with the writers and directors. Itâs hard to believe actual professionals were involved. When you create something, your passion should shine through, whether itâs a fluffy romance or a gritty drama. Instead, this storyline felt like it was put together during a game of story chain with friends who stopped caring three rounds in. In the end, the future of rom-coms is on life support. If filmmakers donât start treating this genre with genuine effort and passion, we might as well kiss it goodbye. Or maybe we already have.",entertainment

Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman died of natural causes about a week after his wife's death, a medical examiner said Friday, ending more than a week of mystery surrounding the death of one of Hollywood's most beloved stars. The bodies of ""The French Connection"" star and his wife were found on February 26 in their home in New Mexico after emergency services were called to their property. ""The cause of death for Mr. Gene Hackman, aged 95 years, is hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor,"" Heather Jarrell, the chief medical examiner for the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, told reporters. ""The cause of death for Miss Betsy Hackman, aged 65 years, is hantavirus, pulmonary syndrome. The manner of death is natural."" Neither body showed any sign of trauma, nor any indication of carbon monoxide poisoning, which had been an initial suggestion. Hantavirus presents as a flu-like disease, with symptoms including fever, muscle aches, cough, sometimes vomiting and diarrhea that can progress to shortness of breath and cardiac or heart failure and lung failure, Jarrell said. ""This occurs after a one- to eight-week exposure to excrement from a particular mouse species that carries hantavirus."" Jarrell said data from Hackman's pacemaker showed its last activity over a week before his body was found when maintenance workers were unable to access the couple's sprawling Santa Fe property. ""Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around February 18. Based on the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that Miss Hackman passed away first, with February 11 being the last time that she was going to be alive,"" said Jarrell. First responders found the door unlocked and open, and pills scattered next to Betsy Hackman's body, which was in the bathroom. Gene Hackman's body was found in another room, fully clothed, with sunglasses nearby, indicating a sudden fall. Investigators suggested it could be the case that the elder Hackman had not realized his wife was dead in the bathroom, given his advanced age and neurodegenerative disease. ""He was in an advanced state of Alzheimer's, and it's quite possible that he was not aware that she was deceased,"" the medical examiner said. A Hackman family spokesperson had previously denied reports of his Alzheimer's disease. In addition to the deceased couple, a dog was found dead in the bathroom, and two other healthy dogs were at the house. Along with the autopsies, the investigation had focussed on piecing together a timeline of the couple's last days, which detectives said had been complicated by their low profile and their preference for privacy. Hackman, a two-time Academy Award winner,Â was credited for intense performances inspired by his troubled upbringing, notching up dozens of movie credits extending into his 70s. He is perhaps best known as vulgar New York cop Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle in the 1971 crime thriller ""The French Connection"" -- for which he won an Oscar for best actor. He won another golden statuette two decades later for best supporting actor for his portrayal of the brutal small-town sheriff ""Little Bill"" Daggett in the 1992 western ""Unforgiven.""",entertainment

Directed by Scott Derrickson, the film presents an ambitious premise that promises much more than it ultimately delivers. The plot centers on a mysterious gorge, hidden from the world and surrounded by thick mist. Since the 1940s, Cold War enemies have stationed elite operatives at nearby towers to guard the chasmâs deadly secret. The story follows two snipers, Levi (Miles Teller) and Drasa (Anya Taylor-Joy), tasked with monitoring the gorge. What begins as a professional mission slowly evolves into a tense and unconventional romance. Written by Zach Dean, known for his work on Fast X and The Tomorrow War, The Gorge offers an eerie setup with lots of potential. The tension between the two lead characters and the perilous environment creates a backdrop for a compelling narrative. Teller and Taylor-Joy deliver strong performances, particularly Taylor-Joy, whose portrayal adds warmth to an otherwise cold, tense world. However, despite these strong performances, the film struggles to balance its emotional stakes with its action-driven plot. The film swings between intimate character moments and intense action sequences, which, while visually impressive, often disrupt the emotional core of the story. The romance between Levi and Drasa is engaging. Still, it frequently takes a backseat to the over-the-top action, which, although visually captivating, can feel jarring against the filmâs more introspective moments. This tonal inconsistency makes it difficult to invest totally in the characters' journey as the rhythm floats between high-energy pieces and slower and more intimate scenes. Dan Laustsen's cinematography is a highlight, capturing the vast isolation of the canyon and the tension between the two protagonists. The action sequences are elegant and choreographed, while the scary score of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross adds an atmospheric touch to the dark moments of the movie. Despite its strong visual identity and exciting sequences, the gorge hesitates in its thematic exploitation. The film suggests deeper questions about human duty, survival, and connection, but does not plunge into these concepts. Although not the deepest movie of the year, the gorge remains a fun walk with solid performances. Its mixture of impressive genres and visuals makes it worth watching but lets you want him to explore his themes and characters deeper. The story may have been more suitable for a six-episode series, allowing suspense and chemistry to truly build.",entertainment

Meghan Markle's new lifestyle show went live on Netflix Tuesday, showcasing the former British royal as a thriving domestic maven. Â  The Duchess of Sussex, wife to Britain's Prince Harry, harvests honey, makes pasta and mixes bath salts against an idyllic California backdrop. Â  A rustic and effortlessly chic home provides the setting for the first episode, whose conceit is that she is hosting a long-time friend. Â  Of course, we're not actually at Markle's house, but rather another luxury property near her home, where camera operators roam, offering purposely wobbly close-ups of candles, crudite and cake. Â  It also seems to have two kitchens. You know, like everyone's house does. Â  Harry -- whom Markle wed in a fairytale ceremony in 2018, and with whom she fled to California two years later -- only makes a fleeting appearance at the end of the eight episodes. Â  But there are little hints about life as a British royal; reminders of how -- in their telling -- the couple were spurned by a stuffy and racist establishment. Â  A friend who comes to stay, makeup artist Daniel Martin, ""has just been in my life from the before, during and after, shall we say,"" Markle tells an off-screen producer, with a meaningful pause to let viewers piece everything together. Â  Episodes of ""With Love, Meghan"" feature appearances from chef Alice Waters, actress Mindy Kaling and Abigail Spencer, one of Markle's ""Suits"" co-stars. Â  The show coincides with a rebranding of Markle's jam-and-cookies online retailer, which was originally called ""American Riviera Orchard"" but is now known as ""As Ever."" Â  The series is the latest effort by the Sussexes to make their own financial way after being cut off from the royal purse. Â  A reported $100 million deal with Netflix yielded the much-talked-about ""Harry & Meghan,"" a six-episode tell-all about their relationship and their high-profile split from the House of Windsor. Â  That was followed by Harry's successful autobiography ""Spare,"" which re-trod much of the same angry ground, with bonus tales about taking drugs in proximity to Hollywood celebs. Â  But subsequent media ventures that have not rehashed the same grievances have fallen flat. Â  A Spotify interview podcast by Markle was not renewed after a first series critics blasted as pointless, while Netflix offerings about the sport of polo and the Invictus Games failed to make much impression. Â  Early reviews of ""With Love, Meghan"" in the British press were not kind, with The Telegraph calling the series an ""exercise in narcissism."" Â  ""Meghan invites people to her pretend house"" wrote the paper's critic, and ""they tell her how amazing she is. This happens for eight episodes,"" it said. Â  Meanwhile Britain's The Times newspaper said the show was desperate in its ""upbeatness"" with Markle ""presenting her extreme wealth and mind-bogglingly exclusive lifestyle as if it is available to anyone.""",entertainment

Prominent Indian singer-songwriter, politician, and cultural personality Kabir Suman has withdrawn his decision to donate his body after death, a commitment he made nearly four years ago. Â  In a Facebook post on Wednesday, the renowned musician wrote, âRamadan Mubarak. I want to inform everyone that some time ago, I announced on Facebook that I had donated my body and did not wish for any religious funeral rites. After much thought, I have changed my decision. I am withdrawing my wish to donate my body.â Â  He added, âI want to be buried in Kolkata, preferably in Gobra, following Islamic traditions. This is my final decision, and I have informed some of my close relatives.â Â  Suman also made it clear that he does not want any criticism or opinions regarding his decision. âI do not want any comments or opinions on this announcement,â he wrote. Â  The singer, born in a Hindu Brahmin family in Indiaâs Odisha on March 16, 1949, as Suman Chattopadhyay, gained immense popularity in the 1990s for introducing a unique musical style blending poetry with melody. Â  In 2000, he converted to Islam and adopted the name Kabir Suman, clarifying that he took the name Kabir after Sheikh Kabir, a Bengali Muslim poet who wrote âBaishnab Padabali.â Â  His groundbreaking album âTomake Chai,â released in April 1992, revolutionised Bengali music. Since then, the singer has remained a celebrated figure in both Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. Â  Beyond music, he was also involved in politics, supporting Mamata Banerjee during the Nandigram and Singur movements. He later became a Member of Parliament from Jadavpur under the Trinamool Congress but eventually parted ways with the party due to ideological differences. Â  Kabir Suman has maintained a deep connection with Bangladesh, which began with his first visit to Dhaka in 1996 to perform at a fundraising concert for the Liberation War Museum. Since 2000, he has been married to the iconic Bangladeshi singer Sabina Yasmin.

""While my detailed writings may embarrass him, the situation has forced me to speak the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be,"" he wrote. Farooki also expressed his admiration for Dr Jamilâs work, saying that he had written one of the most detailed articles about him in the Jaijaidin entertainment magazine âMouchake Dhilâ and had continued to write about him in both Bangla and English newspapers. He emphasized that he still considers Dr Jamil one of the most talented directors in Bangladesh's theater scene. âJust a few days ago, I even requested a foreign ambassador to collaborate with him on a theater production in their country,â he added. However, Farooki pointed out the distinct difference between being a good artist and managing an institution within the bureaucracy and highlighted that while running an organization requires patience and managerial skills, it is crucial to work with colleagues through love and respect rather than intimidation. âThe temperament required for leading a government institution is not the same as directing a theater troupe,â he said. Farooki mentioned that he had initially refrained from commenting out of respect. However, he noted that the need to set the record straight had compelled him to speak out. Farooki expressed his best wishes for Dr Jamilâs future and his creative endeavors. ""If I can be of any help in his future creative work, the ministry will be honored. I will also be happy to assist him after stepping down from my duties, although our fields of work differ,"" he added.

He claimed that he was unable to work independently and faced frequent delays in securing necessary allocations for the academyâs development. He further alleged that lack of cooperation from the government officials and employees, and issues related to corruption and syndicates made it difficult for him to fulfill his responsibilities.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/375027/remembering-haider-rizvi,Remembering Haider Rizvi,"28 Feb 2025, 05:45 PM","It was common knowledge that he had worked with some of the greatest Polish and Hollywood directors, but he hadnât made a film in Bangladesh yet for fund and infrastructure issues Some deaths hit you like a bolt from the blue, even if the storm had been gathering for some time. Haider Rizvi was 80 years old, still working in full capacity, gearing up to direct his first feature length film. It never occurred to us that he may not live to finish the film for which he had won the national film grant. He wasnât ill as far as we knew. But on February 9, 2025, Haider Rizvi passed away after being admitted to the hospital for acute stomach ache. His death resembled his life in a way. The film fraternity, especially his students, mourned him from the depths of their hearts. But the newspapers didnât seem to have taken notice of his passing. Itâs not as if independent filmmakers donât make it to the obituary section. They do. Take for example a director who died two weeks after Haider Rizvi at the age of 60. His death was all over the news, including some Indian papers. His body was placed in front of the National Museum for the general public to pay their last respects, which wasnât something that happened in the case of Rizvi sir. From the outside, it looked as though the mourning of his death was upstaged by someone younger and more accomplished according to the current standards of success. I address him as sir for I was his student back in 2012-2013. He was all of our favourite teacher by far, the only one who understood and appreciated the point of view of our generation. It was common knowledge that he had worked with some of the greatest Polish and Hollywood directors, but he hadnât made a film in Bangladesh yet for fund and infrastructure issues. When I decided to study Screenwriting at UCLA, he had warned me that it might be hard to come back to Bangladesh once Iâve had a taste of working with big names. He confessed, with some regret, it kept him from coming back in his younger days. He was among the first few who asked me to teach screenwriting classes, as a part of the courses he taught at some film institutes in 2017. I later realized how generous it was of him to ask me to take those classes. Teachers in these institutes are paid on a per class basis and most not only refuse to give others any class, they fight over getting more classes themselves; whether theyâre experts in the subject or not is often an overlooked detail. Itâs sort of like the competition of securing more hours among the hourly paid minimum wage earners. But Rizvi sir didnât play those lowly games; no wonder it took him so long to secure that fund to make his film. In class, he used to wear blue jeans with full sleeve shirts, tucked in; always addressed us as âBhaiaâ or âBetaâ. Unlike most of his peers, who abhorred popular films and looked down on the local audience, Rizvi sir vehemently championed films that âmade senseâ and communicated well. He talked very little in class as karma yogis tend to do, but the lionâs share of what he said was gold for us. To this day, I quote him in my classes and remember his teachings when I write scripts. In 2022, one of his students, Razib Ahsan, compiled a book, âHaider Rizvi: Cinemaloker Porompurush,â a treasure trove of write-ups by people close to him. The article by his brother, Gowher Rizvi, was particularly heart-warming. In his article, reading about how Rizvi sir fearlessly participated in the 1971 war, how he used his wit to escape certain death at the hands of Pakistani soldiers, and after independence, how he fought for our television industry only to see it take a nose dive into mediocrity- gives us a picture of his gigantic stature as a person and as a professional. Now from beyond the grave, Rizvi sir keeps inspiring us with the work and the words he left behind. Maybe the world doesnât regard every noteworthy human being with the honour they deserve. Maybe the media doesnât celebrate the silent heroes behind the camera. But that ceases to matter when you know how much you were loved and respected. Iâm glad Rizvi sir got to read that book written on him. Iâm glad, in the end, no Roman Polanski or Lars von Trier could hold him back from returning to Bangladesh. Many would instantly line up to be their assistant directors, but for us, Rizvi sir was irreplaceable.",entertainment

https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/374345/the-art-of-living-finding-beauty-in-simplicity,Art of living: Finding beauty in simplicity with 'Perfect Days',"21 Feb 2025, 02:49 PM","At the heart of Perfect Days is Hirayama, played masterfully by KÅji Yakusho, a middle-aged man who cleans Tokyoâs public restrooms with a sense of devotion rarely seen in modern narratives Wim Wendersâ Perfect Days is more than just a filmâit is an ode to the quiet dignity of a simple life, a meditation on the fulfilment that can be found in daily routines, and a love letter to Tokyoâs hidden corners. Through the eyes of Hirayama, a man who finds joy in the smallest of moments, the film invites us to reconsider what it truly means to be happy. At the heart of Perfect Days is Hirayama, played masterfully by KÅji Yakusho, a middle-aged man who cleans Tokyoâs public restrooms with a sense of devotion rarely seen in modern narratives. His life follows a strict rhythm: waking up in his modest apartment, carefully folding his futon, tending to his plants, and immersing himself in the music of the past through his beloved cassette tapes. His job, often considered menial by society, is performed with meticulous care, transforming public restrooms into pristine, almost sacred spaces. Through Wendersâ lens, these daily rituals become acts of quiet reverence, a reminder that purpose is not dictated by social status but by the dedication we bring to our actions. Hirayamaâs job is not a burden but a craftâone that allows him to experience life with clarity and appreciation. One of the most striking elements of Perfect Days is its ability to turn the mundane into the extraordinary. Whether itâs the sunlight filtering through tree branches, the act of enjoying a canned coffee by the river, or the small interactions with strangers, every moment is presented with a sense of deep, unspoken beauty. Hirayamaâs contentment stands in stark contrast to the modern worldâs obsession with ambition and material success. He has no desire for excess, no need for digital distractions. Instead, he lives fully in each passing moment, savouring the sounds of the city, the touch of the wind, and the rhythms of life. While many films portray Tokyo as a neon-lit metropolis brimming with chaos, Wenders takes us on a journey through its quieter, more intimate spaces. The public restrooms Hirayama cleans are not just facilities they are architectural masterpieces designed by renowned artists, blending functionality with artistry. Each location is captured with a painterly eye, showcasing Tokyo as a city where beauty exists in unexpected places. Wendersâ slow, deliberate cinematography allows the audience to absorb the textures, colours, and rhythms of a life often overlooked. KÅji Yakushoâs performance is one of restraint and quiet depth. Through subtle expressions and body language, he conveys a lifetime of emotionsâsatisfaction, nostalgia, loneliness, and peace. The absence of excessive dialogue makes every glance and movement more profound, allowing the audience to interpret the depths of Hirayamaâs inner world on their own terms. His portrayal earned him the Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival, a testament to the power of his understated brilliance. A meditation on modern life Perfect Days is more than just a character studyâit is an invitation to reflect on our own lives. In an era where people are constantly chasing the next big achievement, the film asks: What if happiness isnât about having more, but about appreciating what we already have? Hirayamaâs life may seem simple, but it is rich with meaning. His love for music, nature, and human connection reminds us that joy is not found in grand gestures, but in the small, everyday moments we often take for granted. Perfect Days is not a film that shoutsâit whispers. It doesnât demand attention; instead, it rewards patience. It is a cinematic experience that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, urging us to slow down, breathe, and find beauty in the world around us. In a time when life feels increasingly fast-paced and complicated, Perfect Days serves as a gentle yet powerful reminder: happiness is not about what we do, but how we choose to experience it.",entertainment

She noted that while the past year posed significant challenges, it also demonstrated the resilience and dignity of the Bangladeshi people. ""I am proud of the partnership between Bangladesh and the UN. It remains grounded in shared values and aspirations,â said Gwyn Lewis. On Thursday, the government of Bangladesh and the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) convened for the biannual meeting of the Joint Steering Committee (JSC) to review the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), launch the 2024 UN Country Results Report, and endorse strategic priorities for the year ahead. Reflecting on a year shaped by political transition, severe climate events, and momentum for reform, the JSC acknowledged the UNâs adaptability in navigating the shifting landscape and its continued support in advancing governance reforms, human rights, and institutional strengthening. In 2024, the UN delivered $215 million in development programming. Key highlights of the UNâs work included supporting the development of the Smooth Transition Strategy for LDC graduation, creating over 4,000 jobs in partnership with the private sector, helping 116 businesses improve their turnover, and providing digital skills training to over 11,000 young people. UN-supported initiatives enabled access to social protection services for 40 million people, while 580,000 children benefited from child protection programmes. Across Bangladesh, 5.6 million adolescent girls were vaccinated against the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) to protect against cervical cancer, covering 93% of girls aged 10â14 in the targeted divisions. In response to climate-related disasters, the UN coordinated $44 million in assistance for flood and cyclone response efforts, delivering humanitarian aid to 1.72 million disaster-affected individuals and raising climate risk awareness among 2 million Bangladeshis. Through its work on governance and gender, the UN supported Village Courts that now serve 66% of rural unionsâreaching 61 million peopleâand backed legislative efforts such as the Sexual Harassment Prevention and Protection Bill and the proposed amendment to the Domestic Violence Act. The meeting, co-chaired by Md Shahriar Kader Siddiky, secretary of the Economic Relations Division (ERD), and Gwyn Lewis, brought together senior representatives from various line ministries and UN agencies. Following the governmentâs decision to extend the Eighth Five-Year Plan by one year, the JSC also endorsed a corresponding one-year extension of the UNSDCF (2022â2026) to ensure alignment with national development planning. A special session was dedicated to the Declaration on Future Generations and the UNâs youth engagement initiatives. Participants discussed strategies to amplify young peopleâs voices and integrate intergenerational equity into national policy, building on the outcomes of the 2024 Summit of the Future. Secretary Siddiky reaffirmed the governmentâs appreciation for the UNâs continued partnership and expressed optimism that the extended Cooperation Framework would serve as a strong platform for deepening collaboration during the transition and beyond. âWe welcome progress on climate financing platforms such as the Bangladesh Climate Development Partnership. Continued support from the UN and development partners remains essential,â said Siddiky. âYouth employment, social enterprises, and impact funding must be prioritized to realize the chief adviserâs âthree zerosâ vision. Urgent attention is also required in areas such as water resource management, local governance, and a responsive UN presence ahead of upcoming reforms and elections,â he added. The meeting concluded with agreement on key next steps, including the launch of the final-year evaluation of the UNSDCF in late 2025 and a renewed commitment to accelerate progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and LDC graduation targets. The Cooperation Framework outlines UN support for Bangladesh across five strategic priorities: Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Development; Equitable Human Development and Wellbeing; a Sustainable, Healthy, and Resilient Environment; Transformative, Participatory, and Inclusive Governance; and Gender Equality and the Elimination of Gender-Based Violence.

The Bangladesh Sustainable Recovery, Emergency Preparedness and Response (B-STRONG) Project will build and reconstruct rural and flood protection infrastructure in Chittagong and Sylhet divisions, providing protection to 1.6 million people, according to a release from the World Bank on Thursday. Taking a comprehensive approach, the project will also promote climate-resilient agriculture and help vulnerable communities with livelihood support. World Bank Interim Country Director for Bangladesh Gayle Martin said that Bangladesh is regarded as a leader in climate change adaptation and disaster preparedness. âBut the increasing climate risks and more frequent and severe natural disasters take a heavy toll on communities and the economy. Building resilience against natural disasters is both a development and an economic priority for Bangladesh,â he said. He mentioned that this project will strengthen the countryâs disaster preparedness system, improve livelihoods, and bolster food security for those hardest hit by floods in Sylhet and Chittagong divisions. This project will help recover from the flood and build resilience to future floods by addressing damages to infrastructure, agriculture, and livelihoods in eastern districts. The project will construct and rehabilitate 79 multi-purpose flood shelters and repair and climate-proof connecting roads and bridges. These shelters will operate as primary schools in normal weather. It will also construct, repair, and rehabilitate flood protection infrastructure, including embankments, and re-excavate canals.

India is targeting uninhabited border areas for these push-ins, Ashrafuzzaman said on Monday while responding to questions from reporters after a meeting of the advisory committee on law and order at the Ministry of Home Affairs. For instance, he said, several areas of Panchari in Khagrachhari and the char areas of Rowmari in Kurigram have already been used. ""These are places that take time to reach for patrolling units,â the BGB chief said. âSo far, 202 individuals have been taken into BGB custody, including 39 Rohingyas.â The BGB director general added that due to tight surveillance in the land border areas, the Indian side could not operate on the ground and instead dropped another 78 people via Indian vessels at a remote char named Manderbaria in the Sundarbans. âThe Coast Guard later rescued them. The process is ongoing to send them back to their respective areas. We have lodged a protest through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,â he added. The BGB chief said India conducted the push-ins on the nights of Wednesday and Thursday. âThe BGB has found 202 people in such instances. The BSF is carrying out push-ins from various corners of the border, particularly in areas where there are no inhabitants. They know that physical surveillance is not possible on every inch of the border.â âSome of these 202 people were verified through the Special Branch of police as Bangladeshi nationals. These individuals had gone to India for work at different times over the past two to three years, even as far back as 20 to 25 years ago. Many had children there, and some of these children even received Aadhaar cards or other Indian documents.â âBut Indian police and the BSF confiscated those and forcibly pushed them into Bangladesh. The process to send those verified as Bangladeshi citizens back to their respective localities is underway. Among them, 39 have been identified as Rohingyas. Some of these Rohingyas had previously been registered in camps here but had fled to India at some point. They have been sent back to the Rohingya camps through the RRC and UNHCR.â The BGB chief added that an alarming issue has emerged: some of the Rohingyas apprehended had been registered as refugees under the UNHCR in India. âThey had ID cards issued there. We are informing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and UNHCR that this is a blatant human rights violation. Refugees should remain in the country where they were registered.â âThe BSF, as usual, is denying the entire matter. They claim to have no knowledge of the events and are saying the Rohingyas had entered India voluntarily and are now returning on their own. We do not accept this,â he added. âWe have lodged a protest note through flag meetings and have also contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging them to raise the issue with the Indian foreign ministry. If the individuals are indeed Bangladeshi, we are willing to take them back, but through a regular process. It cannot happen through clandestine means,â he said. He added that the BGB has received intelligence that around 200â300 more refugees are currently being held across the border near the Khagrachhari frontier. The BSF is waiting for an opportunity to push them in, he claimed. âBut due to heightened BGB patrols and alertness, their efforts have been thwarted over the past two days. Still, they remain in the border areas,â he said.",foreign_affairs

The event honoured the historic triumph of the former Soviet Union over Nazi Germany in 1945, a landmark victory in the Second World War.

In his address, Russian Ambassador to Bangladesh Alexander Grigoryevich Khozin emphasised the enduring importance of historical memory. âRussia will never allow the sacrifices of the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War to be forgotten. Attempts to distort historical truth, justify Nazi collaborators, or diminish the Soviet people's role in victory are unethical and must be rejected,â he said. Echoing similar sentiments, Sattar Mia, president of the Russian Friendship Society with Bangladesh, said: âVictory Day is not only a tribute to past sacrifices, but also a call to safeguard historical truth and advance global peace. Strengthening cultural and educational exchange is key to deepening the enduring friendship between Bangladesh and Russia.â The evening featured a cultural showcase led by the Russian folk music ensemble OBRAZ, complemented by traditional ballet and folk dances from across Russia. A photographic exhibition titled ""The Road to Victory"" highlighted significant wartime moments, offering guests a visual journey through history. The event drew attendance from high-ranking officials of the Government of Bangladesh, foreign envoys, political figures, journalists, and business leaders, reflecting the diplomatic and cultural importance of the occasion.

This is particularly important for Bangladesh in the context of LDC graduation.â British High Commissioner Sarah Cooke said: âBangladeshâs LDC graduation must be backed by strong labour standards. I echo others in expressing my appreciation for the seriousness with which the interim government of Bangladesh has approached this issue.â ILO Country Director Tuomo Poutiainen said: âWeâre very close to shaping the updated Bangladesh Labour Act. What matters now is doing this in a way that stands the test of time and protects workers in the long run.â Legislative Secretary Dr Hafiz Ahmed Chowdhury said: âWe have made substantial legal progress, and our team is working closely with stakeholdersâ. Lutfey also briefed the diplomats on earlier inter-ministerial meetings with the home, labour, and public administration ministries to address politically motivated cases from the previous regime, better dispute resolution mechanisms to avert a logjam in courts, and the issue of insufficient capacity in inspector roles. âThis is not just a domestic issue. Labour rights are now tied to market access, global trade decisions, including the tariff agenda of President Trump. We must act accordingly,â Lutfey said. The diplomats agreed that labour reforms and accountability must remain a priority across all political contexts. Several reaffirmed their countriesâ commitment to supporting Bangladeshâs transition. âThe July uprising provides a unique opportunity for the Bangladesh government to do the right thing.

He was speaking at the ""China-Bangladesh Readers Forum on Xi Jinping: The Governance of China"" at a hotel in Dhaka on Sunday afternoon. ""Modernization is a common task for the Global South. In a matter of decades, China has accomplished what took Western nations centuries,"" he said, adding that it achieved two miraclesârapid economic growth and sustained social stability, debunking the myth that modernization means Westernization. Yao said China's practice offers fresh perspectives and inspires developing nations to pursue their own modernization pathways.Â  Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan, who recently accompanied Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus during his visit to China, spoke as the chief guest.Â  He highlighted the growing relationship between the two countries in key areas.Â  BNP Standing Committee Member Dr Abdul Moyeen Khan, Chief Adviser's Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam, China International Communications Group (CICG) President Du Zhanyuan and Jamaat-e-Islami Nayeb-e-Ameer Dr Syed Abdullah Mohammad Taher also spoke at the event.Â  Through the joint efforts of both countries, the envoy said they have proudly organized this forum about the Bengali edition of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China (volume one).Â  As one of the most important initiatives of the Bangladesh-China year of people-to-people exchanges, Ambassador Yao said this event marks an important part of experience sharing on state governance. ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China"" contains important works by Chinese President Xi Jinping from 2012 to 2022.Â  To date, it has been published in four volumes with 42 language versions, reaching over 180 countries.Â  ""You can find it on the bookshelves of nearly 1,700 major libraries worldwide.

""I often read and study them, especially the parts of vital significance. They articulate the Chinese leader's vision and strategies for the new era, and present the profound yet accessible governance philosophy with timeless wisdom that remains relevant today,â he said. He added: âIf one seeks to understand China's success, the answers lie within these pages."" âThis work opens a window for Bangladeshi readers to understand contemporary China,â said the ambassador.Â  ""Lots of Bangladeshi friends used to ask me how China could lift nearly 100 million people out of poverty. And I told them that you may find the answers in this book,"" he said.Â  China's remarkable socioeconomic transformation would not have been possible without the great theoretical guidance, he mentioned.Â  Through this important work, the ambassador hoped their Bangladeshi friends would gain deeper insights into China's development path, governance philosophy, and guiding principles. ""This work provides a useful reference for Bangladesh on its way to modernization,"" he said. ""This work is a new platform for us to engage and learn from each other. China's neighbourhood diplomacy is built upon the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness,"" said Ambassador Yao.Â  âChief Adviser Professor Yunus visited China in March and reached a consensus on many issues with President Xi,â he said.

This has directly impacted the Dhaka Stock Exchange, as the market saw a major drop at the start of the trading day on Wednesday, hours after the attacks. However, the impact is not limited to the capital market; the ripple effects of this conflict are touching multiple sectors of Bangladeshâs economy. Experts warn that if the conflict turns into a full-blown and prolonged war, Bangladesh could face serious challenges in trade, investment, inflation, remittance, and diplomatic balance. Economists emphasize the urgent need for strategic planning by the government and policymakers.Â  Without prior preparation to tackle the multidimensional pressure that war could bring, Bangladeshâs economy may come under significant strain, they say. Despite tensions between India and Pakistan, both countries maintain commercial ties with Bangladesh, especially India, which is one of Bangladeshâs top import partners. In a war scenario, border trade, transit routes, and South Asian maritime transport corridors could be disrupted. There is also concern about potential delays or cancellations in exports of Bangladeshâs ready-made garments, pharmaceuticals, and light engineering products. A rise in political instability in South Asia may lead foreign investors to label the region as a âhigh-risk zone,â which could reduce both existing and potential foreign direct investment (FDI). Many ongoing projects in infrastructure, textiles, ICT, and renewable energy could come to a halt. Economists believe that if the war continues, multiple sectors in Bangladeshâs economy will be negatively impacted, especially foreign trade, investment, logistics, export orders, and supply chains. Given the close trade relationship between Bangladesh and India, any military conflict could directly affect imports and exports. Additionally, if India increases its military spending, it may scale back domestic development projects and regional cooperation efforts, which could impede Bangladeshâs economic progress. Dr Mustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow at the private research organization Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), said: âAlthough the current state of war between India and Pakistan may not pose a major threat to Bangladeshâs business activities, it is a matter of serious concern. Tensions between two nuclear powers can have negative consequences for regional stability and cooperation.â He added: âIndia is an important trade partner for Bangladesh. A significant portion of our exports goes to the Indian market under duty-free access. An increase in Indian military spending could impact its economic priorities, which may negatively affect Bangladeshâs exports.â BKMEA President Mohammad Hatem, representing the knitwear manufacturers, echoed the concern that war between India and Pakistan will not just affect them but also neighbouring economies like Bangladesh. At a discussion event held at Sonargaon Hotel on Wednesday, he said: âA war would disrupt import-export routes. We rely heavily on importing raw materials like yarn and fabric. Any disruption in the supply chain due to war will have a direct impact on our garment industry.â He added: âWar is never beneficial for any country. If the flames of war spread, border-adjacent countries like ours will also suffer economically.â Experts suggest that amid this crisis, Bangladesh must diversify its trade strategies, look for alternative markets, and strengthen diplomatic efforts. Furthermore, export-oriented industries must adopt disciplined strategies while monitoring global demand and price fluctuations. Amid the India-Pakistan conflict, Bangladeshâs stock market suffered a major crash on Wednesday. At the end of the day, the DSEX index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) dropped by 149 points or nearly 3%, closing at 4,802 pointsâthe lowest in five years. This single-day fall is the largest since October 29, 2024. Panic among investors led to massive sell-offs. On Wednesday, only nine company stocks rose in value, while 385 fell, and five remained unchanged. Ashequr Rahman, managing director of Midway Securities, told Bangla Tribune: âThe India-Pakistan war situation has created extreme instability in the market. Geopolitical uncertainty is frightening investors. Many are selling shares out of fear for safety.â He also mentioned that a letter from the Financial Institutions Division (FID) arrived on Wednesday morning, saying: âOn May 11, a high-level meeting will be held at the office of the chief adviser. The finance adviser, FID secretary, and BSEC chairman will be present. The meeting will discuss measures to stabilize the market.â However, this positive message was not enough to immediately restore investor confidence. A potential war could drive up global fuel prices. If the price of imported crude oil and LNG from the Middle East increases, the cost of electricity production in Bangladesh will rise. This could trigger widespread inflation across the industrial and consumer levels. Particularly, if transportation and agricultural production costs rise, food prices may spiral out of control. Stakeholders have expressed concern that many Bangladeshi expatriate workers are based in the Middle East and Malaysia. The political atmosphere in these regions may also be affected by India-Pakistan tensions. If the war drags on, labour markets could stagnate, threatening a decline in remittance earnings. Bangladesh maintains political and diplomatic ties with both India and Pakistan.Â  In the wake of a war, the country may need to adopt a cautious stance to avoid offending either side. In this context, maintaining balance with regional and global allies could become Bangladeshâs primary diplomatic strategy.",foreign_affairs

These projects are geared towards supporting Bangladesh's sustainable development by protecting the environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change risks. During the meetings, the finance adviser emphasized the need for increased investment in human resource development and infrastructure to address the challenges of LDC graduation and escaping the middle-income trap. He urged the EU and its institutions to provide more grant-based or concessional loan assistance in strategic sectors. The finance adviser also held a bilateral meeting with representatives from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). JBIC has long been a key partner in Bangladesh's development, providing support through project financing, strategic partnerships and investment cooperation. Notable financing from JBIC includes the DAP-2 Fertilizer Factory (â¬715.6 million, fully repaid), the equipment for the Ghorashal Fertilizer Factory (supplied by Mitsubishi), and the Meghna Ghat Power Project (â¬265 million, co-financed with ADB).

The adviser came up with the request during a bilateral meeting with Dr Abdullah bin Nasser Abuthnain, vice minister of Human Resources and Social Development of Saudi Arabia, on the sidelines of the 7th Global Summit on Occupational Health and Safety, held in Riyadh. He also proposed verifying employers' capacities and job availability before issuing work visas, signing employment contracts online prior to departure and introducing special pre-departure training courses for both male and female workers, which would cover Saudi labour laws, work culture, and essential information. Besides, he invited the Saudi authorities to visit Technical Training Centres (TTCs) in Bangladesh and expressed interest in designating one or more TTCs exclusively for training Saudi-bound workers. He also suggested sending Bangladeshi trainers to Saudi Arabia for advanced technical and language training so that they can later deliver high-quality training back home. Asif Nazrul also reaffirmed his ministry's commitment to reducing the training duration for domestic workers and showed interest in implementing Saudi Arabia's integrated training program for domestic workers from various countries. He emphasised training female domestic workers in Arabic language skills and use of modern household appliances. âThe workers would undergo one month of training prior to visa issuance and complete a short refresher course within two weeks of receiving their visas before departing for Saudi Arabia,â he said. He expressed appreciation for the formation of a working team involving officials from the Saudi Ministry of Human Resources and the Bangladesh Embassy to address the specific challenges faced by undocumented Bangladeshi workers in Saudi Arabia, as discussed in the January 30 meeting. He also mentioned the recent formation of a high-powered task force to tackle issues related to irregular recruitment and undocumented workers in line with the latest Foreign Office Consultations. Asif Nazrul, also the law adviser, expressed hope that both the working team and the task force would play vital roles in resolving the issues faced by Bangladeshi workers in Saudi Arabia. Speaking as a panelist at the Global Summit, held at the Kingdom Tower in Riyadh, the adviser identified key challenges faced by developing countries in ensuring occupational health and safety, including limited resources, lack of skilled manpower and advanced technology, weak law enforcement, and resistance from influential entities.

We see this political transition as leading up to the democratic election. From the EU, we donât have any opinion on time, we are not pressuring anyone to hold an election on a particular date,â Miller said while responding to a question at the DCAB Talk held at the National Press Club on Monday. Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh (DCAB) hosted the event, where DCAB President AKM Moinuddin and General Secretary Md Arifuzzaman Mamun also spoke. Miller said they are waiting for political parties and the interim government to agree on a very clearly prioritized and specific list of reforms and noted that they do have experience, which is helpful and financing which can support. ""And we have the political will to stand with you,â he added. Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus recently said the people of Bangladesh think that the interim government is still the âgood answerâ for them, but stressed that they will not go beyond June 2026 to hold the ""best election ever"" in the country. Yunus, who is also chairman of the National Consensus Commission, stressed the urgency of accelerating reform efforts to ensure that the national election is held between December this year and June 2026. Ambassador Miller said they think there needs to be sufficient time to implement the reforms under this interim government. Based on deaths reported by various credible sources, the UN's report estimates that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed between July 1 and August 15, and thousands were injured, the vast majority of whom were shot by Bangladeshâs security forces. Responding to a question, the EU ambassador said they support the work of the UN fact-finding mission and laid emphasis on accountability for those âterrible crimesâ perpetrated against the people during the July uprising. Highlighting the importance of Bangladeshâs judicial authoritiesâ evidence-based work, Miller hoped that Bangladesh would deal with the terrible crimes perpetrated against its people. âThere must be accountability. There must be a transparent and fair process and the rights of every single person should be respected through due process,â he added.Â  Miller said the interim government inherited a very great number of challenges, including on security, economy and financial fronts and rebuilding confidence takes time. Talking about womenâs rights, the EU envoy said equality between men and women is the core value in Europe and it is a core universal value.Â  He said the work of the Womenâs Affairs Reform Commission should be examined extremely carefully and they support all efforts that ensure equality between men and women. âThe report and the recommendations of the Womenâs Affairs Reform Commission are extremely important. We consider equality between men and women as the core value of the EU,â said Ambassador Miller. He said the recommendations of the commission should be looked at extremely carefully and closely by political parties because they would like to see those recommendations translated into actions. âWe will contribute towards greater equality,â he said. In response to a question on the Rohingya issue, Ambassador Miller said that unfortunately, this is a crisis that goes on despite the best efforts of Bangladesh and partners like the European Union. âThere are enormous efforts being made by Bangladesh,â he said, adding that there is violence on the other side of the border. âWe are indeed trying very hard to support a political solution, which is the only solution to this crisis,â said Miller. âI have to say, we have many conversations with the Bangladesh authorities, those conversations always concluded with a common understanding that return can only be in a safe, dignified, and voluntary manner,â he added. As a humanitarian partner for Bangladesh, Miller said they are quite happy to be pragmatic on how they can meet the needs of the refugees. The European Union has maintained a consistent level of support over the past seven years. In 2025, the European Union has already allocated over â¬32 million to support the Rohingya refugees and their Bangladeshi host communities. These funds are provided via the Joint Response Plan, which we are launching on Monday. The European Union also supports Rohingya refugees who have fled to other countries in the region, as well as the Rohingya who remain in Myanmar. âOur total support for the Rohingya since 2017 equals nearly â¬1 billion provided together by the EU and its Member States,â he said.",foreign_affairs

Indian security officials claim the individuals had planned to meet with Bangladeshi Kuki-Chin separatist leaders residing in the state, reports Bangla Tribune.Â  The duo arrived in Aizawl on an Indigo Airlines flight the previous afternoon. Upon landing, they were interrogated by security personnel. Though they had entered India on tourist visas, authorities reported that they failed to provide satisfactory answers regarding their intended activities within Mizoram. As a result, they were taken into custody at the airport and arrangements were made to deport them the following day on a separate flight. Sources from Indian security agencies revealed that a clandestine meeting was scheduled between the detained individuals and Nathan Lanchheu Bawm, the fugitive founder of the Kuki-Chin National Army. Lanchheu Bawm is currently underground, and his whereabouts remain unknown. Intelligence inputs had earlier warned of at least four American nationals arriving in Aizawl in early May with intentions to connect with the Kuki-Chin leadership. Among them, two individualsâidentified as ""Chekun"" and ""Saran""âwere named, while the identities of the other two were withheld. According to these inputs, the visitors were expected to travel from Aizawl to Lunglei district, which borders Bangladesh, to visit refugee camps housing members of the Bawm community. Based on this intelligence, security officials moved to detain two of the four expected visitors. It is worth noting that when the Kuki-Chin National Front was formed in Bangladeshâs Chittagong Hill Tracts a few years ago, two American citizens of Kuki-Chin descent had reportedly played an active roleâboth in terms of direct involvement and financial support. However, it remains unconfirmed whether the individuals deported this weekend were the same people involved in the group's founding.",foreign_affairs

However, the interim government has set certain conditions for this arrangement. Only if these conditions are met will Dhaka allow the use of Bangladeshi territory for the corridor. An official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told this correspondent that a conducive environment is necessary in Rakhine State for the transportation and distribution of aid, adding that if such an environment is created on the other side of the border, Bangladesh is willing to permit the humanitarian corridor. The Myanmar junta is engaged in conflict with the Arakan Army (AA) in Rakhine. A report published by the United Nations in February states that the most severe conditions in all of Myanmar are currently in Rakhine state. The report accuses all parties involved in the conflict of serious human rights violations, noting that millions of civiliansâincluding the Rohingya, the Rakhine, and other ethnic minoritiesâhave been displaced. Due to the ongoing conflict, the majority of the affected population remains completely cut off from humanitarian assistance, the report says. The UN warned of an impending famine, saying that more than two million people are at risk of starving to death. Bangladesh has placed several conditions for permitting a humanitarian corridor to send aid into Rakhine. These include: Aid transportation and distribution in Rakhine require a favourable environment. Without it, the aid operation could be disrupted. A ceasefire or an arrangement is necessary to ensure that aid sent via the UN from Bangladesh is not adversely affected by the conflict. Rakhine is home to Arakanese, Rohingya, and other ethnic minorities. Bangladesh emphasized the importance of distributing aid to all groups equally, without any form of discrimination. In other words, the stronger groups, such as the Arakanese, must not be allowed to monopolize aid at the expense of others. No conditions should be imposed on the recipients during aid distribution. Bangladesh said aid cannot be linked to certain actions or inactions and no requirements or restrictions should be applied. Another official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: âWhen there is a food shortage in Rakhine, there is always the risk that certain groups may try to enter Bangladesh. This concern has been taken seriously by Bangladesh.Â  âAt the same time, ensuring a conducive environment and non-discriminatory distribution is essential for making aid delivery sustainable and effective.â Notably, a UN report published in November said that between March and April this year, internal food production would only meet 20% of the populationâs needs. A lack of seeds and fertilizer, adverse weather, and a rise in internally displaced people unable to farm have all contributed to the decline in rice production, the report said. With almost all trade and commerce in Rakhine coming to a halt, more than two million people are now at risk of starvation, according to the report.",foreign_affairs

""Bangladesh has not issued any travel alert yet. However, I believe it would be wise to avoid travelling during this period of conflict unless it is absolutely necessary,"" Touhid said while speaking to reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday. His statement comes as troops from Pakistan and India exchanged fire in disputed Kashmir for a third night in a row, officials said, as relations between the nuclear-armed rivals plunged to their lowest level in years. India has accused Pakistan of supporting ""cross-border terrorism"" after gunmen killed 26 people in the worst attack on civilians in contested Muslim-majority Kashmir for a quarter of a century. Islamabad has denied any involvement, calling attempts to link Pakistan to the attack ""frivolous"" and vowing to respond to any Indian action.

Even if we do, we must first verify whether they are indeed Bangladeshi nationals. If they are, we will certainly bring them back. ""However, it must be proven, because there are many Bangla speakers in India. Speaking Bangla alone does not confirm someoneâs Bangladeshi identity.""

India had long been providing us with transhipment facilities, but they have now withdrawn them. We must find ways to deal with this situation,"" he said.

""We know that India and Pakistan have long-standing disputes, but we do not want any major conflict to emerge that could endanger the people of this region,"" he said.

""Qatar can use its good offices to put pressure on Myanmar for starting the repatriation of Rohingya people without any further delay,"" Yunus said while addressing a high-level roundtable titled ""Social and Environmental Challenges Around Forcibly Displaced Populations â The Case of the Rohingya"" on the second day of his tour to Qatar. The meeting was held at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Doha in the morning. In his speech, Yunus said that given the renewed international geopolitical and geostrategic scenario, Qatar could strongly express its solidarity in resolving the issue and be proactive in engaging OIC countries to raise more funds and impose pressure on the international community to advocate for the repatriation of the Rohingyas. Recalling Qatarâs role in supporting the Rohingyas, the chief adviser said the country was among the first to provide immediate assistance and support after the outbreak of the Rohingya crisis in 2017. Qatar also took strong diplomatic positions on the Rohingya issue in various international forums, he said, adding that the amir of Qatar made several bold statements in this regard. On September 19, 2017, during the opening session of the 72nd United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Qatar Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani called upon the Myanmar government and the international community to assume their legal and moral responsibilities to take necessary measures to stop the violence against the Rohingya minority. The amir also called for ensuring protection for the Rohingyas, repatriating the displaced to their homeland, preventing sectarian or ethnic discrimination against them, and guaranteeing their full legitimate rights as citizens. In his address, Yunus highlighted that Qatar Charity provides a wide range of humanitarian aid to the Rohingya refugees in the camps of Cox's Bazar and Bhasan Char in Bangladesh, reaching more than 234,313 refugees. The assistance from Qatar includes medical supplies, such as emergency medical tests and essential medicines; school supplies like bags, uniforms, toys, and benches; cooking gas cylinders to reduce environmental damage; and 326 shelters in Cox's Bazar. Qatar Charity (QC) also launched an agricultural ""Livelihood"" project in Bhasan Char in June 2023, he said. The chief adviser noted that Qatar initiated the provision of LPG gas cylinders for Rohingya families. QC has provided LPG cylinders benefiting 23,000 refugees, he said, adding that such initiatives help protect the environment from further degradation. ""Therefore, Qatar may provide more LPG facilities for the Rohingya community,"" he said. Yunus mentioned that on December 9, Bangladesh National Security Adviser and High Representative for Rohingya and Priority Affairs Dr Khalilur Rahman met with the minister of state for foreign affairs of Qatar, Dr Mohammed bin Abdulaziz bin Saleh Al Khulaifi, in Doha. During the meeting, he said, the high representative called for Qatar's robust cooperation in ensuring the repatriation of Rohingyas to Myanmar and noted that resolving the crisis requires attention and concerted efforts from the global community. In response, Dr Khulaifi assured broad cooperation from Qatar and reiterated the countryâs commitment to addressing the plight of the Rohingyas, emphasizing the nation's focus on their humanitarian needs and shared faith, Yunus said.

The individuals are wanted by the requesting member country or international tribunal. Member countries apply their own laws in deciding whether to arrest a person, it said. The majority of red notices are restricted to law enforcement use only, it added. Extracts of red notices are published at the request of the member country concerned and where the publicâs help may be needed to locate an individual or if the individual may pose a threat to public safety. The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has filed a number of cases against Benazir on various charges, including for acquiring wealth through corruption and abuse of power while serving in key positions and money laundering. Benazir Ahmed served as IGP from April 15, 2020, to September 30, 2022.

Despite being declared the winner by the Election Tribunal and having the result officially gazetted by the Election Commission, Ishraque has not yet been given mayoral responsibilities, the protesters said. The protest began at 9am and was ongoing as of the filing of this report. jwARI.fetch( $( ""#ari-image-jw6828456f9f638"" ) ); The protesters said Ishraque is the legitimate mayor according to the tribunal's verdict and the Election Commissionâs gazette.

They warned that they will continue their sit-in in front of the Nagar Bhaban until Ishraque is sworn in and escalate their protest if necessary. Delwar Hossain, a resident of Ward 42, said: âIshraque was the real winner of the 2020 election, but the government abused its power to declare Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh the mayor. The court has now proven Ishraque to be the legitimate mayor. Yet, he has not been sworn in, which is highly suspicious.â He added: âWe are only demanding that the legitimate mayor take the oath. If he is not sworn in by the end of the day, we will announce tougher programs.â The DSCC election took place on February 1, 2020. Awami Leagueâs Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh was declared mayor after he defeated BNP candidate Ishraque Hossain by 188,083 votes. However, on March 27 this year, the Dhaka Election Tribunal overturned that result and declared Ishraque the valid mayor. On April 22, the Election Commission sent the tribunalâs verdict to the Law Ministry for opinion. When no response came within the stipulated time, the commission published a gazette on April 27 declaring Ishraque as mayor. On April 30, the commission said the gazette had been issued to implement the courtâs order. Later, it confirmed it would not appeal the ruling. However, more than two weeks have passed since the gazette was issued, and Ishraque has yet to take the oath, as the Local Government Divisionâresponsible for arranging the ceremonyâhas not done so. Taposh assumed office as mayor on May 16, 2020, following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first board meeting took place in the first week of June that year.

In response to a question, he said there are plans to organize a seminar on NID issues with media representatives. âThose contributing to streamlining NID services will also be included. It is yet to be decided whether representatives from political parties will be invited,â he added. On the issue of Rohingyas being listed in the voter roll, he said the registration process has recently been completed across the country, including in 56 special upazilas. âDue to our technological capacity, Rohingyas cannot become voters. Strict screening will be conducted during registration,â he said. Regarding expatriate voter registration, Humayun said the process is currently underway in eight countries and will be launched in Canada next week, bringing the total to nine countries. He mentioned that a major challenge in expanding the service to other countries is the lack of space in embassies. âWe have held meetings with the ministries of foreign affairs and finance. An inter-ministerial meeting next week will identify and resolve these issues, aiming to launch the service in at least 40 countries,â he added. He also noted that the process has not started in the United States due to the lack of necessary approval.",election

This is now a standing decision,â Election Commissioner Abul Fazal Md Sanaullah told reporters after a meeting of the commission on Wednesday. He referred to a recent case where a petition was filed concerning a Rohingya being allegedly included in the voter list during a Union Parishad election in Coxâs Bazar last year. The petitioner had sought to halt the election, but the court instead directed authorities to investigate the matter. âWe regularly update voter lists, especially in sensitive areas like the Coxâs Bazar region to prevent Rohingya infiltration,â Sanaullah said. The commissioner said: âHowever, if anyone manages to get in through fraudulent means, we now have a policy to remove them immediately.â Acknowledging citizen frustration on the delay in correcting information in the National Identity Card (NID) the commissioner said the commission has taken plan for simplifying the process. âIf an application is made without dishonest intent, we will resolve it easily and quickly.â he said.

Sanaullah said the NID database currently has about 2,09,000 cases flagged for biometric duplication-roughly 0.16% of the entire database. âIn many cases, this happens because fingerprints are unclear, especially among workers or elderly persons. We have decided to speed up how we handle these false matches,â he added.

During the seminar, titled âDevelopment of the Voting System for Expatriatesâ at Nirbachan Bhaban in Dhaka, representatives of 21 political parties, including the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, CPB, BaSaD, NCP, Gono Odhikar Parishad, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, and the Labour Party, presented their positions on the issue. The BNP delegation, led by Standing Committee Member Nazrul Islam Khan, said the party will finalize its stance after internal discussions and submit its opinion to the EC by May 15. Speaking to reporters after the seminar, he said: âEnsuring the voting rights of expatriates cannot rely solely on the National ID (NID); passports must also be considered, as many expatriates do not possess NID cards.â He added that the BNP previously advocated for expatriate voting rights during the ECâs 2014 initiative to amend the Representation of the People Order (RPO), and reiterated this position in its 2017 Vision 2030, 2022âs 27-point reform outline, and the 31-point state reform proposal in 2023. âWe fully support any initiative to enable expatriates to participate in national elections,â he said. When asked whether the BNP believes the expatriate voting process will be transparent, he remarked: âNo system in the world is foolproof; otherwise, reform or revolution would not be necessary. We will evaluate and support the process that is simplest, most comprehensible, widely acceptable, and cost-effective.â Jamaat-e-Islami Office Secretary Matiur Rahman Akand also spoke to the media.  He said that his party previously raised the issue with the EC, and while the commission has taken steps in that direction, trust in the EC has eroded over the past 15 years. âPeople have lost confidence and trust in the EC,â he added. Regarding concerns about ""proxy voting,"" Matiur said: âIf person X supports one candidate and Y supports another, and Xâs proxy vote is given to Y, the voter's intention is not accurately reflected. We will decide on our position after internal discussions. But we believe the peopleâs will must be honoured and the system must not be compromised under any circumstances.â Kazi Sajjad Zahir Chandan, presidium member of the Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB), said: âEach of the three proposed methodsâonline, proxy, and postal votingâhas its pros and cons. Parties should deliberate among themselves before deciding. With 15 million expatriate voters, the impact on the national election is significant. Hence, a cautious and inclusive approach is essential. The EC must work to build trust among the parties.â In his concluding remarks, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) AMM Nasir Uddin thanked the participants, saying: âYou have engaged in valuable discussions throughout the day.

To build this consensus and demand a roadmap for an early election, the party has been holding a series of meetings not only with the parties participating in the simultaneous movement against the Awami League government but also with various left-leaning and Islamist political groups. According to BNP sources, although the party is calling for the election by December, it would not object if the polls are delayed slightly into January or February. However, the BNP expects a clear and specific roadmap for the election in the current context. These meetings with political parties are primarily aimed at creating pressure on the government and uniting all political forces in the country around the demand for elections. Since April 19, the BNP has been holding a series of meetings with its partners in the simultaneous movement as well as parties that have boycotted previous elections, in an effort to build national consensus for an election. BNPâs liaison committee has already met with Gono Odhikar Parishad, Gono Forum, CPB, BaSaD, LDP, Labour Party, NPP, and the Democratic Left Alliance, among others. BNP leaders say that discussions are being held to unite all political parties to restore democracy through elections. Moazzem Hossain Alal, adviser to the BNP Chairperson, said: âOur party has repeatedly called for a specific roadmap, but we have yet to see anything concrete. We want a fair election to be held based on the consensus of all political parties.â BNP Standing Committee member Nazrul Islam Khan added: âThe BNP has long been campaigning to restore democracy in the country and is continuing dialogue with all sides. We want to strengthen relations among political parties and build a strong alliance. This is part of our electoral preparation.â Meanwhile, left-leaning political parties have also been demanding early elections since shortly after the fall of the Awami League government. Leaders of these parties believe that the government must first complete the necessary reforms and then announce a concrete roadmap to hold a free and fair election. They also seek BNPâs cooperation in this effort.Â  Ruhin Hossain Prince, general secretary of the Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB), said: âEarly elections will be good for everyone in the country. Weâre seeing ominous forces trying to rise. To prevent the country from falling into the wrong hands, elections are essential. And for that, national unity is absolutely crucial. If we cannot reach a consensus on the election issue, holding elections on time will not be possible.â Another party that has met with the BNP is Gono Odhikar Parishad, which is also urging the government to hold elections without delay. The party warns that failure to do so could lead to instability. Rashed Khan, general secretary of Gono Odhikar Parishad, said: âThe election must be held by December. For that, we urgently need an electoral roadmap. We expect the government to announce this roadmap without delay. Furthermore, to ensure a fair election, the two student advisers currently in government must resign.â Analysts believe that if elections are not held by December, the country may head toward instability, not only politically but also economically and socially. Failure of the interim government to hold an acceptable election by December could plunge democracy in Bangladesh into a deeper crisis. Commenting on the matter, Professor Dr Lt Col Nazmul Ahsan Kalimullah, chairman of Jatiya Nirbachon Parjobekkhon Parishad (Janipop), said: âThere is pressure from all sides to organize the election. If the election is not held within a specific timeframe, ominous consequences await the country. The government should heed everyoneâs demands and immediately declare a roadmap to hand over power through a free and fair election.â",election

But when it goes into its full-pledged preparations for the national election, we think it should go through the final report of the Consensus Commission,â said NCP Chief Coordinator Nasiruddin Patwary, replying to a question from reporters after a meeting with Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin. A five-member NCP delegation, led by Nasiruddin Patwary, sat in a meeting with the CEC around 12:15pm at the latter's office in the capital to discuss different issues, including electoral reforms. The NCP chief coordinator said their party is focusing on the implementation of the decisions of the National Consensus Commission. ""If they do not agree with the same issues of the Consensus Commission, we will not be able to keep that kind of trust in them,"" he said. The new party also expressed doubts about the ECâs comment regarding the election roadmap before the Chief Adviser. âWe hear many things from the EC that we did not hear from our chief adviser. We did not hear about the roadmap from the chief adviser. But it came from the EC. So, we would like to say that the EC needs to be careful in its place to speak in any place,"" he said. He said the EC can start its work in line with the announcement of the Chief Adviser over holding the election from December to June 2026. ""But when they speak on their own before the roadmap or any direction comes from the government, we are suspicious,"" he added. Noting that NCP, in a letter sent to the EC on April 17, focused on the reform issues, Nasiruddin said they demanded the Election Commission hold the election following reforms in line with the public demand. In reply to another question, he said the Act of 2022 (CEC and EC Appointment Act) is illegal, and they are opposing the law. It depends on the report of the Consensus Commission whether the present CEC and election commissioners would stay in charge. âAfter the report of the Consensus Commission is finalised, and if they can stay as per the report, they will stay. If they cannot, they will not. It will depend on the report of the Consensus Commission. We do not have any objection to anyone. The constitutional body should be constituted according to the report of the Consensus Commission,â he said. The NCP leader said the report of the electoral system reform commission led by Dr Badiul Alam Majumdar should be fully implemented in the next general election. âWe told them that it will have to go for the next election through the implementation of page by page, word by word of the reform report,â he said. During the two-hour meeting, the NCP placed several demands before the CEC, including the presence of an aspirant in person during submission of his or her nomination paper, renewal of existing registered political parties after every five years, extending the timeframe for party registration, and a provision to issue a certification over fairness and credibility of an election by the Election Commission within 48 hours before the gazette notification. Besides, the new party demanded that the officials and candidates who were involved in the last three national elections be brought under a visible trial process, and the voting rights of the expatriate Bangladeshis be ensured. Other demands include barring loan defaulters from contesting the election, cancellation of candidacy in case of providing false information in the affidavit, and bringing changes to the electoral code of conduct and provisions related to election expenditures to control the use of money. The NCP delegation members include its joint conveners Anik Ray, Khaled Saifullah, Mujahidul Islam Shahin, and Tajnuva Habib. On Thursday, the NCP, a newly-formed political party led by youths, in an application asked the Election Commission to extend the deadline for applying for party registration by at least 90 more days.

Md Sanaullah also discussed the outcomes of a workshop held on Tuesday by the Election Commission, which aimed to gather opinions from technical experts on determining a suitable voting system for expatriates. He said the experts suggested that a single voting method would not be sufficient for Bangladesh; rather, a mixed system would be more appropriate. Sanaullah noted that each systemâpostal, online, or proxy votingâhas its own merits and limitations. All of them will require trial runs, mock testing, and possibly piloting before they can be introduced on a larger scale. âWe will form an advisory team today with experts from among the workshop participants. This team will work over the next 10 to 12 days to address the weaknesses of the three systemsâpostal, online, and proxyâand make them more robust and practical,â the election commissioner said. He added that it was the chief adviser who initially emphasized the importance of ensuring voting rights for expatriates. Out of 178 countries in the world, 115 have provisions allowing their citizens abroad to vote. The most commonly used method is manual voting at embassies, followed by postal voting, and then online or proxy voting, he added. âWe are not ruling out or favoring any single option,â said Md Sanaullah. âOur goal is to at least introduce a system that enables expatriates to cast their votes.â He further noted that although a postal balloting system currently exists for expatriate Bangladeshis, it has proven to be ineffective. âNot a single expatriate cast their vote in the 12th parliamentary election through the postal balloting system,â he said.",election
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/378146/ec-seeks-expert-opinions-to-determine-voting,Will EC consider the proxy voting system for expatriates?,"08 Apr 2025, 01:28 PM","The existing law, which allows for voting via postal ballot, has proven to be ineffective and impractical, and the growing need for reform is undeniable Bangladesh has a significant diaspora spread across the globe, yet expatriates have long been unable to exercise their constitutional right to vote, despite growing demands. The existing law, which allows for voting via postal ballot, has proven to be ineffective and impractical, and the growing need for reform is undeniable. The postal ballot system, enshrined under Article 27 of ""The Representation of the People Order, 1972,"" has largely failed to meet the needs of expatriates. The timeline of the postal ballot process, taking 24 to 35 days from dispatch to return, does not allow enough time to complete the voting process before the election. In response to this issue, the interim government and the Election Commission (EC) are working to fulfill the longstanding demand of the diaspora. To this end, the EC formed a committee to study and recommend practical solutions for diaspora voting. This committee has proposed three potential options, which, after further study and deliberations, could be implemented in the short to long term. On Tuesday, A workshop has been organized to obtain expert input and further refine these options. According to the EC committee report, the existing postal ballot system is a major point of concern. As mentioned, the law allows for diaspora voting through postal ballots, but due to time constraints and inefficiencies, it has failed to be a viable solution. The process, which involves the dispatch and return of ballots, typically takes 24 to 35 days. However, the report further mentioned that, by the time the ballots are printed and ready for dispatch, only 10 to 12 days remain to complete the process, leaving insufficient time for voters to receive and return their ballots before the election. This timeline discrepancy makes it impossible to use the postal ballot system effectively. To gain perspective, many countries worldwide have adopted various methods of diaspora voting. Around 100 countries and territories facilitate expatriate voting, with several methods in use. The most common methods include in-person voting at embassy offices or designated locations, postal voting, absentee voting (as practiced in the USA), online voting (adopted by countries like Mexico, Estonia, the Philippines, and the USA, with trials in countries such as India and Pakistan), and proxy voting, noted by the commission report. However, proxy voting allows a voter to designate a trusted individual to cast their vote on their behalf. Countries like India (for military personnel overseas), Australia, the UK, several EU nations, and parts of Canada have adopted this method to varying degrees. Meanwhile, the Electoral Reform Commission (ERC) has recommended two primary options for expatriate voting: IT-supported postal ballots and online voting. The committee has thoroughly studied these options and explored their feasibility. While both options offer potential, they are not without challenges. Online voting, despite being an attractive option, has yet to be universally embraced due to security and technical concerns, with countries like Mexico and Estonia among those leading the way in testing this method. However, the committee has also recommended conducting a pilot project to explore the possibility of online voting in the future. The committee has expressed a strong preference for proxy voting as the most viable option for the upcoming elections. Proxy voting is seen as the only feasible method that can be deployed globally, allowing for the broadest participation among expatriates. Under this system, a voter would select a trusted individual to cast their vote in person on their behalf. This method, which requires registration for eligible voters, seems to be the most practical and universally applicable option for expatriate Bangladeshis. The registration process for these voting methods would ensure that only voters on the list are eligible to participate. In terms of developing the architecture for expatriate voting, the committee has outlined several key criteria for each of the proposed methods: ensuring the integrity of the voter and vote, maintaining system security, meeting timeliness requirements, providing ease of understanding for voters, ensuring cost-effectiveness, and establishing an audit trail or other record-keeping systems where necessary. On Tuesday, the Electoral Training Institute (ETI), a wing of the Election Commission, hosted a workshop to discuss and develop practical models for diaspora voting. The workshop, attended by around 80 participants, included experts from Dhaka University (DU), Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet), and the Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST), as well as government and non-government stakeholders. The objective of the workshop was to devise feasible architectures for the three proposed voting methods. These architectures will be presented to stakeholders for feedback, and once a consensus is reached, the system will be fully developed and tested. The workshop's discussions focused on developing models that ensure security, integrity, timeliness, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness. An oversight team, comprising experts from the EC and other technical institutions, will synthesize the proposed architectures and create one final model, with variations where necessary, for each voting method. Globally, 115 out of 178 countries and territories provide a mechanism for expatriate voting, with a variety of methods in use. In-person voting is the most common (74%), followed by postal voting (58%), online voting (10%), and proxy voting (5%). Additionally, a small number of countries, such as India, the UK, and parts of Canada, have adopted proxy voting as a viable option. The EC is keenly focused on the proxy voting method for Bangladeshâs expatriates, as it seems to be the most feasible and widely applicable. Registration processes for expatriate voting vary, with some countries requiring expatriates to register for each election, others offering registration for a set period, and some allowing permanent registration. In a briefing on Tuesday, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) AMM Nasir Uddin said that the EC will finalize the expatriate voting system following consultations with technical experts. The CEC emphasized the importance of prioritizing expatriate voting rights and expressed confidence that the workshop would help determine the most suitable voting method. âI believe that today's workshop will help us determine a specific voting method,â he said. He further explained that any chosen system would be piloted in select countries before being expanded. The CEC reaffirmed the ECâs commitment, along with the Interim Governmentâs, to facilitating expatriate voting in the upcoming elections. He explained that while many expatriates have requested the right to vote, it has proven to be a complex issue. After extensive deliberation, the EC is focusing on three potential methods: postal voting, online voting, and proxy voting, with proxy voting emerging as the preferred choice. The CEC pointed to Germanyâs experience with proxy voting as a model to consider. Election Commissioner Abul Fazal Md Sanaullah also addressed the workshop, noting that while postal and online voting methods might not be effective in Bangladesh, proxy voting appeared to be the most appropriate option for expatriates. At the workshop, experts from Dhaka University (DU) emphasized that both domestic and international attention will be on the election organized by the interim government. They cautioned that introducing any new voting methods could risk creating controversy and unfairness, and instead, they argued that only the existing voting system, one that is widely recognized and accepted, should be considered. However, some foreign stakeholders advocated for proxy voting, citing global examples and the technological advancements that could ensure its accuracy and reliability.",election

The draft, currently under internal review, is expected to introduce stricter regulations on campaign spending and greater discipline across all forms of electioneering, including social media, Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker said following a meeting of the committee on constituency re-demarcation (electoral area), political party registration, and election preparedness at Nirbachan Bhaban on Monday. He said the guiding principle behind the proposed code is the creation of a truly level playing field. âWeâre working on a code that allows all candidates to campaign equally and fairly,â he said, adding that the goal is to minimize campaign expenditure while maintaining order throughout the process. The draft, he said, is nearly complete and will be placed before the full commission for approval before being published. The commissioner also confirmed that the majority of recommendations from the Election System Reform Commission have been incorporated, along with additional measures drawn from past experiences with local elections and media-related issues. âWe expect this to be an excellent and effective code of conduct,â he said. Among the key additions is a clause that seeks to regulate campaign activities on social mediaânow an increasingly contentious arena. âThere are clear provisions to ensure online campaigning remains within acceptable limits,â Anwarul said, noting that the draft includes provisions for strong penalties in case of violations. âWeâre committed to strict enforcement. There will be no leniency.â Significantly, the code is expected to be finalized before formal consultations with political parties. When asked about this, Anwarul downplayed the issue. âWeâll engage with all stakeholders at the appropriate time. The situation on the ground will dictate the nature of that engagement,â he said. He also confirmed that preparations are being made with December in mind as the likely election timeline. However, one unresolved matter is the redrawing of constituency boundaries. âThe proposal for boundary revisions has been sent to the government. It hasnât been approved yet,â he said. âIf the legal amendments are passed, weâll act accordingly. Otherwise, weâll proceed using the existing boundaries.â",election

Rizvi made the comment during an Eid gift distribution program for rickshaw-van and auto-rickshaw drivers on behalf of BNPâs Acting Chairman, Tarique Rahman, in Naya Paltan, Dhaka, reports Bangla Tribune. He said that if everyone does not sacrifice in a people's uprising, the image of the interim government will be tarnished. He urged the government to announce a clear and specific date for the national election, instead of making ambiguous statements about whether it will be held in December or June. The BNP leader mentioned that many people have questioned whether the movement was solely for holding elections. The movement occurred because the elections were not fair, as Sheikh Hasina failed to ensure a free and fair process, he said. For the sake of retaining power, she turned the country into a battlefield, he added. Rizvi further said that while the interim government is not directly elected by the people, it has the support of the people. All the protesting parties have shown their support for it, he said. Referring to workers, he said that 122 garment factories' workers have not received their wages, and 150 garment factories' workers have not received their bonuses.

Rizvi also claimed that Ishrak has received justice and added that Sheikh Hasina's government had destroyed the country's electoral system.

We hope that political parties will start preparing for the elections with great enthusiasm and excitement,â he said in a speech to the nation on the occasion of Independence Day and Eid-ul-Fitr. At the same time, reaffirming his commitment to prosecuting those responsible for July mass killings, the chief adviser said: âI want to assure you that those involved in these killings, those who have killed people indiscriminately, and those who have already been recognized as murderers by the world will certainly be brought to justice.â Highlighting the progress of the National Consensus Commission's work, Yunus said: âThe process of gathering opinions from all political parties through the Consensus Commission is currently underway. The commissionâs goal is to identify issues on which political parties have reached a consensus and prepare a list of those issues. The signatures of the parties that agree will be collected. This list will be known as the July Charter.Â  âOur responsibility is to present the entire process transparently to the nation and organize the elections upon completion of this process.â Stating that letters have been sent to 38 political parties along with 166 recommendations and a full report from six reform commissions, he said: âMeetings with political parties have already begun. The political parties of the country have responded very positively to the reform efforts and are expressing their opinions.â Welcoming the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights' report on the July uprising, the chief adviser said: âThe interim government is seriously considering the recommendations made in the report.â Dr Yunus continued: âThe report has clearly revealed that Sheikh Hasina herself instructed security forces to kill protesters. The previous government, the Awami League, and its allied groups and organizations were collectively involved in systematic and severe human rights violations. According to the High Commissionerâs report, nearly 1,400 people were killed during the protests, including approximately 13% children.Â  âBeing at the forefront of the protests, our July daughters were attacked by security forces and Awami League supporters and were even subjected to sexual violence.â âReading the UN report has sent chills down everyone's spine.

The chief adviser commented that women's participation in the July uprising was the highest among all the movements and struggles in the history of Bangladesh.Â  He said: âThe July uprising has changed the course of Bangladeshâs history. After July, we hope that the position of women will change positively. We want to rethink Bangladesh, and in this new thinking, we want to prioritize womenâs position at the highest level.â He continued: âThere is a need to build a social movement against those who harbor misogynistic thoughts and tendencies to belittle women.â Regarding the rights of minorities, the chief adviser said: âAlong with womenâs rights, it is equally important to remember the civil rights of minorities. The civil rights of the indigenous communities of the plains and hills must also be protected. If any citizen's rights are neglected, it will create a major crisis for the nation.Â  âWe must ensure that none of us, as citizens, are guilty of violating another citizenâs rights.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/376595/election-commission-rejects-20-reform-proposals,Election Commission rejects 20 reform proposals citing threat to authority,"18 Mar 2025, 01:40 PM","In a letter, the EC raised its logic behind its stance contradicting the reform proposals The Election Commission has opposed at least 20 reform recommendations made by the Electoral System Reform Commission arguing that it would undermine its authority and create complexities. In a letter sent to the National Consensus Commission on Monday, the EC also raised its logic behind its stance contradicting the reform proposals. EC Senior Secretary Akhtar Ahmed on Monday told reporters that they sent their opinions, expressing different views over some recommendations to Vice Chairman of the National Consensus Commission Prof Ali Riaz. He said if the recommendations are implemented, it would undermine the ECâs authority. Major areas where the Election Commission expressed different views are delimitation of constituencies, local body elections, appointment of returning officers and assistant returning officers, submission of nomination papers, qualification and disqualification for a candidate, certification of fairness and credibility of the national election, identity card management and ECâs accountability. About the proposal for formation of a separate independent commission for the delimitation of constituency, the Election Commission thinks if the task is shifted to a separate body, it would undermine the ECâs authority given by the constitution, an effective norm, cause the waste of time unnecessarily, create complexity and enhance the government costs for separate budget and formation of organisation structure for the separate entity. Besides, the EC is an independent entity and it has five and half a decade-long experiences and competences as well as an institutional memory in this regard. The reform commission recommended that smaller district population quota for the small districts and greater district population quota for the larger districts with maximum plus or minus 10% deviation should be considered during the delimitation of constituencies. But in the case of the Dhaka and Chattogram City Corporation areas, the deviation can be highest plus or minus 15%. It also proposed that three CHT constituencies should be considered as protected constituencies. The EC argued that the proposal is unrealistic, as it would require the demarcation of over 200 constituencies and lead to a gradual increase in the number of constituencies in city areas. It also said geographical position and integrity, population size, voter size, administrative units and advantages are rightly being considered during the delimitation of constituencies as per the existing laws. The Electoral System Reform Commission recommended that the national election and the elections to all local government bodies should be held during a caretaker government extending its tenure to four months. But the EC contradicted the recommendation saying that it is not possible to hold all the elections properly within such a short time as it took on an average one year to complete the elections to all local bodies in phases. The reform commission suggested arrangement of local government elections before the national election. But the EC opposed it saying it would delay the national election. The reform commission recommended that ECâs own officers should be given priority during appointment of returning officers and assistant returning officers and if adequate ECâs officers are not found, then officers from administration and other cadres should be appointed. In this regard, the EC said the priority should be exercised here considering the capacity and seniority. The reform commission suggested that the EC should issue a gazette notification to certify fairness, credibility and acceptance of a national election within 48 hours of the election and before the publication of result in gazette notifications. But the EC said it is unnecessary as the commission, being satisfied about the election, publishes results in gazette notification. Besides, the presiding officers and returning officers were already given enough authority in the laws for holding elections in fair and credible manners. The gazette notifications are issued following their reports. The Election Commission said if they deem that a presiding officer or returning officer does any injustice or adopt any unjust means, the commission has authority to take actions against the person concerned. The reform commission recommended that if a political party is aggrieved with the announcement to certify the fairness and credibility of a national election, there should be a scope for it to lodge any complaint with the National Constitutional Council or the Supreme Court within 48 hours. In that case, the council or the court shall settle the complaints within seven working days. About the recommendation, the Election Commission said if such provision is made, the defeated political parties would get scope to make an election questionable unnecessarily. Since there is a provision to file a petition with the electoral tribunal (High Court) challenging the fairness of election as per the Article 49 of the Representation of People Order 1972, the recommended provision is unnecessary. The reform commission recommended a provision so that ECâs legal, financial and administrative proposal should be placed before an all-party parliamentary committee led by the Speaker of the parliament or the proposed upper house instead of a ministry. Following the discussion with the EC, the all-party committee shall send the proposals to the authority concerned to take necessary steps. But the EC said it is not the job of a parliamentary committee, rather it is an executive task. Besides, it would intensify purposive influence and make the process lengthy. The reform commission proposed that if election commissioners failed to perform their constitutional duty or breach their oaths, then such complaints can be investigated by the all-party parliamentary committee and send recommendations including taking legal actions to the president. In this regard, the EC said this recommendation would invite a bad result as the explanation of âfailureâ word is relative. Besides, the Election Commission would not be able to take a firm stance fearing reprisal. The reform commission recommended formation of an independent national citizen data commission to register, preserve and distribute national identity cards within the next seven years. Birth and Death Registration Information System (BDRIS), and Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) shall be taken under the citizen data commission. In this case, the Election Commission said if the NID database containing the voter lists is shifted to any other entity, it will contradict the constitution and undermine ECâs constitutional authority. Now 186 firms like Bangladesh Police, intelligence agencies, Bangladesh Bank, NBR, Land Ministry, government and private banks receive services from the NID database. The reform commission recommended that if a person announced by a court as a âfugitive accusedâ canât contest the election. But the EC said this provision can be applied for ill-motives. The reform commission suggested dropping the RPO provision that requires the elapsing of three year times following retirement of a person who was in the executive post of a non-government organization to contest in the election. But the Election Commission thinks the provision should be upheld. The reform commission recommended all aspirants except those who are under legal custody should mandatorily present in person during submission of the nomination paper. In this regard, the Election Commission said there should be scope for both online submission and offline submission; otherwise there might be recurrence of instances as occurred in 2014.",election

""Do not follow anyone's instructions blindly; stay within the boundaries of the law,"" he told the police force. He also expressed his concern, saying: ""Our only fear is that we should not lose our way again. The students have protected us, but we must ensure we do not return to the darkness."" Â  Yunus said: ""We must remember that we are in a state of war. Since August 8, we have forgotten that the war is ongoing. It is not over. We are in a continuous state of conflict, and we must emerge victorious from it. ""The defeated forces will try to create chaos and disturbances. The police force must be alert to such attempts."" Â  He warned: ""This situation will continue to intensify. If we remain cautious, it will not escalate further. New forms of misinformation will arise, intended to mislead, so stay alert.""Â  The chief adviser also addressed the issue of police verification for passports, saying after the removal of police verification for passports, many began claiming that Rohingyas would receive passports. ""We clarified that the UNHCR holds the database of Rohingyas and through biometric checks, it will be evident if someone is a resident of the Rohingya camps. The passport authorities will make the decision and there is no need for police verification, as technology is assisting us."" Â  He added: ""In a few days, Starlink will be activated. Once operational, you will experience the speed of the internet, which has never been this fast before, bringing everything into the palm of your hand.""",election

It may be 7-8 or 9-10,â said EC Senior Secretary Akhtar Ahmed while talking to reporters at his office in the capital on Monday. Raising some different views, he said the formation of a commission for the delimitation of constituencies as recommended by the reform commission is not needed. âWe have said that the commission over the delimitation of constituencies is not needed,â he said. Besides, Akhtar said, the formula of plus or minus 10% voters for the delimitation of constituencies, is also not required. The EC argued that if the formula is followed, the number of constituencies in the urban areas will be significantly high and would be disproportionate as the influx of people towards urban areas is enormous. Talking about other different views, Akhtar said there is a proposal that the EC should make an announcement through a public notification in favour of fairness, credibility and acceptance of a national election within 48 hours of the balloting and before the issuance of gazette notification. About this proposal, he said the EC thinks this certification is not needed as a returning officer does not announce unofficial election results, if he or she is not satisfied. The EC secretary said they think the number of voters and people and also geographical integrity should rightly be considered here. Akhtar, however, said they agreed to the reform proposal to keep the national identity services under the authority of the Election Commission. Now the EC is properly providing services to 186 firms from the NID server.",election

The mission heads of 10 OIC countries stations in Dhaka were present at the meeting held at Nirbachan Bhaban in the capital. Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin, three election commissioners and the EC secretary were present. Md Sanaullah said: ""The heads of the missions of the OIC member countries were invited to the meeting as part of a series of views-exchanges with the development partner countries and organizations."" âWeâve informed them about our current activities, democratic transition and all the activities we have undertaken focusing on the upcoming national elections. We also expect their cooperation regarding the voting of our expatriate Bangladeshis living in various countries.â he said.

We have welcomed them,â he said. In the meeting, the EC discussed its preparation, future action plans and possible areas of cooperation through a formal presentation, said Md Sanaullah. He said the Election Commission wants to set a good democratic instance with its future-oriented action plans. âWe don't want to walk back towards the past anymore. We want to move forward. We want to create a good democratic example,â he said replying to a question. Responding to another question, the election commissioner said they shortlisted three systems â postal, online and proxy balloting systemâ to ensure the voting of the expatriates. He, however, said the postal ballot is currently ineffective. âDiscussions were held with them (foreign diplomats) today about the online method,â he said. In this regard, the Egyptian ambassador said their experience was not good as they started and stopped online voting. The Pakistani representative said their initial experience was good, they are not in a position to fully launch online from trial level. About the proxy balloting system, the election commissioner said this system is in operation in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. The proxy system is also in operation in India for soldiers. He said now a person with physical challenges can also vote with the help of another person in Bangladesh. Besides, lands and other assets can be sold by another person through power of attorney. âIf we want to let our expatriates vote on a large scale, then there seems to be no other option than proxy voting. Because the remaining two options can only be introduced on piloting level and may not be introduced for a large scale,"" said Md Sanaullah. Talking to reporters, Malaysian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Mohd Shuhad Othman said Bangladesh has a big number of expatriates who are currently living in Malaysia. âMalaysia also supports all the reforms including the electoral reforms being undertaken by the Bangladesh government,â he said. Â âMalaysia is willing to share its experience especially for the overseas workers for free, fair and credible elections,â said the envoy.

The newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP), spearheaded by student leaders of the July-August mass uprising, has stepped into the political arena but is yet to apply for registration with the EC. Without registration, the party will be unable to contest the national elections.

While traditional voter bases continue to support established parties, fresh political voices are beginning to emerge among younger demographics.Â  Notably, the Awami League, one of Bangladeshâs oldest and most dominant parties, has managed to edge out the newly established student-led political party, particularly among Gen Z voters.Â  The student-led party lagged significantly behind with just 5% overall.Â  Within the Gen Z cohort, the Awami League received 11% support, narrowly outpacing the student-led partyâs 10% share. Once a dominant force, the Awami Leagueâs credibility eroded over years of alleged election manipulation, political repression and corruption.Â  The tipping point came in 2024 when a mass uprising, sparked by the killing of students, led to widespread protests against the government.Â  The student-led movement gained momentum, culminating in the ouster of Sheikh Hasinaâs government.Â  This movement, driven by demands for transparency, accountability and democratic reforms, has since transformed into a formidable political force.Â  The student-led partyâs rise reflects a growing disillusionment with traditional political structures and a desire for change among the electorate. The BNP enjoys overwhelming support among older voters, with nearly 47% of Gen X and Boomers II respondents favoring the party.Â  In contrast, the Jamaat-e-Islamiâs base is relatively stronger among the Post War generation (35%) and surprisingly holds 34% support among Gen Z voters, suggesting that while the party has a traditionalist image, it also resonates with younger voters.Â  Both BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami exhibit marginally higher acceptance among rural votersâBNP at 42% rural versus 40% urban and Jamaat-e-Islami at 32% rural versus 30% urban.Â  This rural loyalty underscores the partiesâ effective grassroots mobilization strategies. BNP support remains consistent across genders (42% among men and 41% among women).Â  Conversely, Jamaat-e-Islamiâs appeal is slightly stronger among male voters (33%) compared to female voters (30%).Â  These survey results highlight the entrenched support for traditional parties in Bangladesh.Â  The BNPâs edge among older and rural voters, combined with Jamaat-e-Islamiâs surprising hold among both the youngest and the oldest demographics, signals that any shift in voter sentiment will hinge on how well emerging political forces can challenge these established networks.Â  With candidate performance taking center stage in voter decision-making, the next election campaign will likely be a test of each partyâs ability to showcase credible, performance-based leadership. After reviewing extensive survey data and comparable trends in recent political reporting, it is clear that while the Awami League retains a loyal, if shrinking, base among older voters, the emerging student-led party is slowly gaining traction among youth.Â ",election

When making their voting decisions, 38% of respondents indicated that a candidateâs past performance as an MP is the most important factor.Â  In contrast, only 22% said that they always vote for the same party.Â  This suggests that a significant portion of the electorate prioritizes individual accountability and track record over blind party allegiance.Â  Additionally, 14% of voters expressed a combination of influences, while 9% either could not comment or found the issue not applicable. The survey further underscores the impact of grassroots and local dynamics on voting behavior.Â  Nearly one in four voters (22%) reported that local party activities influence their decision, and 21% said that religion-based politics also play a role.Â  Household influences remain strong, with 47% of voters citing family members as the primary influence on their decision-making, and 20% mentioning neighbors. Media also plays a significant part - 18% of respondents rely on news from social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and TikTok, while traditional channels like television news influence 15% of voters.Â  These findings indicate a generational shift in information consumption, with younger voters leaning more toward digital sources. Among those still undecided about their voting choice, 29% have yet to commit, with 49% waiting to learn more about the candidates and 34% monitoring pre-election developments.Â  This uncertainty, coupled with the overall voter apathy observed in past elections, points to a potential volatility in the upcoming electoral contest. Drawing on comparable trends reported in recent political surveys, the findings suggest that the electorate is not only frustrated by past inaction but is also increasingly focused on evaluating candidates on merit rather than party brand.Â  With nearly half of voters historically abstaining from the ballot box, political parties face an urgent challenge: to engage an apathetic electorate by demonstrating tangible improvements and accountability. As political parties refine their campaign strategies in anticipation of an early election, these insights highlight the critical need for candidate-centered messaging and localized outreach.Â  The coming months are expected to witness heightened political activity as candidates work to convert undecided voters to their cause and re-engage those who have remained on the sidelines.",election

""If reforms can be done as quickly as we wish, then December would be the time that we would hold elections. If you have a longer version of reforms, then we may need a few more months,"" he told the BBC in a recent interview. About taking the helm of the interim government, he said he felt ""dazzled"" when asked to take charge after Sheikh Hasina was driven out of power last year. ""I had no idea I would be leading the government,"" Yunus said. He said restoring law and order and fixing the economy are priorities for the country. It is unclear if Hasina, who fled into exile in India, and her party will participate in the election Yunus's administration hopes to hold later this year. She is wanted in Bangladesh for alleged crimes against humanity, read a BBC report released on Thursday. ""They (the Awami League) have to decide if they want to do it; I cannot decide for them,"" said Yunus in his interview with the BBC at his official residence in Dhaka. ""The Election Commission decides who participates in elections,"" he said. He added: ""Peace and order is the most important thing, and the economy. It is a shattered economy, a devastated economy."" ""It is as if there has been some terrible tornado for 16 years, and we are trying to pick up the pieces,"" he continued. ""We are coming from complete disorder,"" the chief adviser said, referring to the violent protests that engulfed Bangladesh last year. ""People getting shot, killed,"" he said. But almost seven months on, people in Dhaka say law and order has not yet been restored, and that things are not getting better, the BBC report said. ""Better is a relative term,"" Prof Yunus said. ""If you are comparing it to the last year, for example, at the same time, it looks okay,"" he added. ""What is happening right now is no different than any other time,"" he said. Yunus blamed many of Bangladesh's current woes on the previous government. Victims of Sheikh Hasina's brutal regime remain angry. Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in recent months, demanding she be prosecuted for the deadly crackdown on student protesters. A court in Bangladesh has issued a warrant for her arrest, but India has yet to respond. When asked by the BBC about claims by members of the Awami League that Bangladesh is not safe for them, Yunus was quick to defend his government. There are courts, laws and police stations, he said. ""They can go and complain, register their complaint."" ""You just do not go to a BBC correspondent to complain, you go to the police station to complain and see whether the law is taking its course."" The Trump administration's decision to cut foreign aid and effectively end almost all programs funded by the US Agency for International Development will have an impact on countries like Bangladesh. ""It is their decision,"" Yunus said. ""It has been helpful. Because they are doing things that we wanted to get done, like fighting corruption and things like that, which we could not afford right away,"" he said. The United States is the third largest supplier of official development assistance to Bangladesh. Last year, the US committed $450m in foreign aid. When asked how it will make up the shortfall, the chief adviser said: ""When it happens, we will make do.""",election

The commissioner made the statement while speaking to journalists after inspecting the Dhamrai Upazila Election Office on Thursday morning. Masud said: âYou have already heard multiple times that the chief adviser and all officials have confirmed the parliamentary election will take place by December. Therefore, our primary focus is on the parliamentary election, and we are not currently thinking about local elections.â Before addressing the media, the upazila administration honoured the commissioner with a guard of honour on the upazila parishad premises. Regarding local elections, Masud explained that although reforms are underway, the government has not issued any directives or requests for conducting local elections. He noted that these elections take place in multiple phases, spanning almost a year. Conducting local elections now would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to hold the parliamentary election in December or January, he added. âOur main goal is to ensure the parliamentary election takes place.

In its recommendations, the commission said elections for union councils, upazila councils, municipalities, city corporations, and district councils can be completed by June, according to a summary of the recommendations submitted to the government last Wednesday. Failure to do so may lead to legal complications, as the terms of many local government institutions will expire before elections are held, it said. The commission suggested that by March or April, two consolidated local government lawsâapplicable to both plain and hilly regionsâcan be enacted through an ordinance, allowing elections to be held nationwide by June. The proposed Local Government Commission is expected to complete the necessary groundwork on this matter before April. However, the reform commission emphasized that achieving this goal will require consensus between the government, political parties, and the Election Commission regarding national elections. The commission also sees an opportunity to introduce a parliamentary system within local government. While discussions on this matter have been ongoing for a long time, no concrete steps have been taken. The commission now asserts that the conditions are favourable for such a reform. The commissionâs initial recommendations highlight that ""following the July uprising, local government institutions are practically nonexistent."" It asserts that now is the time to reorganize and hold elections for all local government bodies simultaneously, painting a ""new picture on a transparent canvas."" Otherwise, the expiration of terms for multiple institutions before elections are conducted may lead to legal complications. The commission further argues that these elections would require a maximum of one and a half to two months, once every five years, making the process more cost-effective and efficient. To facilitate this, the commission has drafted two uniform or integrated local government laws, which the interim government could enact as ordinances or a future elected government could adopt as legislation. The commission also notes that the functions and services of local government institutions should be tailored to specific needs. It recommends reviewing and updating existing regulations concerning governance, legislative and executive activities, standing committees, manpower management, and other administrative matters. The proposed Local Government Commission, comprising experts, would play a key role in this process and assist the relevant ministry. Regarding elections in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the commission suggests amending the Hill Tracts Council and Regional Council Act to incorporate these areas into the parliamentary structure, allowing elections for the three hill district councils to be held by June. Currently, five primary laws govern local government in Bangladesh, excluding the Chittagong Hill Tracts: Since these laws vary, the structures of union, upazila, and district councils lack consistency. The reform commission proposed integrating the three rural local government bodies under a single law, while municipalities and city corporations should be governed by another separate unified law. This structural reform aims to streamline governance and ensure uniformity across all local government institutions.",election

Following the meeting, Left Democratic Alliance Coordinator Iqbal Kabir Zahid spoke to journalists, reaffirming their demand for an early national election. Seven senior leaders from the alliance attended the meeting at the EC headquarters, where they presented a seven-point demand. Iqbal Kabir said that the fall of the previous government resulted from widespread movements against its authoritarian rule and systemic inequalities. He stressed that the first priority following this change should be a return to a democratic system, urging the EC to expedite the electoral process. He also criticized efforts to create confusion by debating whether local government or national elections should come first, insisting that the parliamentary polls must be held within this year. Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) President Shah Alam also addressed the media, rejecting the notion that reforms must precede elections. He argued that reforms and elections can take place simultaneously and accused the government of deliberately delaying the process by prioritizing local elections over national ones. He warned that such delays would be detrimental to the country, leading to further political and social complications. He added that the prevailing climate of fear and suffocation in the country would persist unless a stable government is established through national elections. CPB General Secretary Ruhin Hossain Prince echoed this sentiment, saying that any delay in announcing an election date would be unacceptable. He said the EC assured them that it is fully prepared to conduct parliamentary elections and would act based on political consensus. When asked whether the government was intentionally stalling, he pointed out that most political parties had expressed a preference for national elections first during discussions with the interim government.

However, key stakeholders and political parties continue to press for a clear electoral roadmap. Election Commissioner Abul Fazal Md Sanaullah shared this update after meeting yesterday with ambassadors and representatives from 18 development partner nations, including the UNDP.  This meeting and announcement come six months after the July mass uprising that reshaped the countryâs political landscape. Yet the central question remains: When will the roadmap be announced? Speculation has been rife since Mondayâs meeting between Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus and BNP leaders, during which indications surfaced that both sides are leaning toward a December election. Following this, on Monday, Chief Adviserâs Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam said in a briefing that the first consensus meeting between political parties and the Election Commission is set for February 15. Still, many political parties remain unconvinced.Â  They argue that a formal roadmap from the interim government is essential to confirm the commitment to holding elections within the declared timeframe. They had expected that specifying the roadmapâs release date would clarify the schedule for the upcoming meeting between the Chief Adviser and the political parties. Yesterday, the Election Commission made it clear that there are no plans for local elections before the national polls. While EC officials acknowledged that the government has the authority to call local government elections earlier, they reiterated that their primary focus remains on preparing for the parliamentary vote. Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives Ministry Adviser Asif Mahmud Sajib Bhuiyan echoed this sentiment on Monday, saying that although a policy decision regarding local elections has been reached, a final decision is yet to be made. During the post-meeting press conference, the EC chief referred to Chief Adviser Yunusâs December 16 speech, in which he outlined two possible election timelines: a December 2025 poll if minimal reforms are pursued, or a mid-2026 election if additional time is needed for deeper electoral changes. The EC is preparing for the earliest possible date while maintaining flexibility. One key issue raised during the discussion was whether national and local elections could be held simultaneously. The EC chief addressed this by stating that although the idea was floated, logistical constraints make it unlikely. Based on past experiences, he explained that conducting local elections in multiple phases can take up to a yearâsomething that would inevitably delay the national vote. For now, the ECâs priority remains the general elections. âIf the government decides to hold local government elections before the general election, we will execute that decision accordingly. But for now, our focus is on national polls,â Sanaullah said.Â  Regarding the scope of local elections, he added: âThe decision on which local government bodies will go to the polls before the national elections lies with the government. Only then can the EC assess whether it would impact the general election timeline.â However, following a meeting with the Chief Adviser on Monday, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir made it clear that his party will not accept any local government elections ahead of the national polls. âWe have said beforeâand we are saying it againâthat there will be no elections before the national election,â he asserted.Â  When pressed on the timeline for the election roadmap, Fakhrul responded: âThat is up to them [the government]. They might say something by February 15.â Expressing optimism about a free and fair electoral process, UNDP Bangladeshâs Resident Representative, Stefan Liller, stated that the upcoming national elections could be the most credible in the country's history.

In response, a UN team visited Bangladesh for two weeks in January to assess the types of technical assistance that could be provided. Representatives from key international stakeholders participated in the meeting, including delegates from the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, Australia, Spain, Canada, Germany, China, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, France, South Korea, the EU, and Turkey.

The partyâs primary goal is to re-establish the peopleâs right to vote and maintain the transparency and impartiality of the countryâs democratic institutions. Several sources within the party confirmed that a decision was made to pressure the government during a standing committee meeting chaired by the partyâs Acting Chairman, Tarique Rahman, on Monday night. At a press conference on Tuesday, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said: âWe think there is no reason to delay the elections. The elections are possible by the middle of this year, that is, by July-August.âÂ  He urged the government and the Election Commission to conduct elections by August for the nationâs benefit. Earlier, on December 16, the Chief Adviser to the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, suggested that national elections could be held between the end of 2025 and the beginning of 2026.Â  His Press Secretary, Shafiqul Alam, later clarified that elections could be expected by June 30, 2026. However, BNP leaders argue that organizing elections by August is feasible after the completion of necessary reforms, including those relating to measures by the Election Commission.Â  They have warned of potential movements if elections are not held within this timeframe. Mirza Fakhrul emphasized the urgency, saying: âNow is a very sensitive time. The nation is now in a very critical period. We will appeal to all not to obstruct this path to democracy in any way.â BNP Joint Secretary General Syed Moazzem Hossain Alal explained the partyâs demand for elections between July and August to Dhaka Tribune. He said: âIf the government wants, it can organize elections earlier. We are giving the government quite some time. And the issue of organizing elections is the responsibility of the Election Commission. The government has no business here. We see that the law and order in the country and the security of the people have deteriorated greatly. The country is going economically backward. Therefore, we want a democratic government to be established through quick elections to resolve these problems.â For its part, the government has proposed holding elections by June next year after implementing reforms. In response to whether the BNP will allow time for reforms, Alal said, âWe are giving the government sufficient time to initiate reforms. Our discussions with the government regarding reforms are ongoing. We want to give them some more time. They will be able to complete the reforms and organize elections during this time.â When asked about potential movements if elections are not held by August, Alal said: âWe have supported this government and are continuing to do so. We want the government to understand the language of the people and organize elections quickly.â BNP Standing Committee Member Salahuddin Ahmed expressed the nationâs anticipation for elections, saying: âWe want elections before July-August. The nation is now expecting a fair election. We are saying that elections should be organised after completing the reforms required for the elections. Election preparations and reforms must be taken forward together.â He added: âThe main task of this government is to organize fair elections. We overthrew a fascist government for the sake of elections. If any excuse is made about the elections, the people will reject it.â Ruhin Hossain Prince, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB), echoing the BNPâs call for early elections, said: âThe issue of holding elections depends on the sincere will of the government. It can hold an election anytime if it wants. We, the political parties, are ready for the elections. The voters are also ready to vote. We think it is possible to hold an election by mid-2025.â Prince emphasized that reforms should not delay elections, saying: âReforms are an ongoing issue in the world. Elections cannot be stopped by talking about reforms. The reforms that are needed for holding elections should be carried out and elections should be held quickly. The elected government will make the remaining reforms when it comes to power. If they do not keep the promises made to the people, the people will judge them. And this government is not working well. The longer it is in power, the more chances there are ofÂ  evil forces emerging. That is why we want early elections.â Rashed Khan, general secretary of the Gana Odhikar Parishad, called for a national dialogue to announce a roadmap for elections.Â  He said: âThe government should announce a roadmap for the elections through a national dialogue. Owing to the absence of an election roadmap, our doubts are increasing. We want an announcement of a roadmap for early elections like other parties.â",election
https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/371037/election-reform-commission-outlines-sweeping,Election Reform Commission outlines sweeping changes for electoral overhaul,"17 Jan 2025, 08:30 AM","In a bid to ensure fair and transparent elections, the Election Reform Commission has proposed over 150 recommendations across 16 key areas.Â  These proposals include disqualifying individuals convicted by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) from contesting elections or holding political party positions, introducing a âno-voteâ provision, and mandating re-elections in constituencies where voter turnout is below 40%.Â  The commission, led by Badiul Alam Majumdar, secretary of Shushashoner Jonno Nagorik (SUJAN), also called for granting the Election Commission greater autonomy and accountability.Â  It further recommended investigating irregularities in the 2018 elections and enhancing transparency in the operations of political parties.Â  The recommendations, submitted to Chief Advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus on Wednesday, emphasize the need for comprehensive reforms to rebuild public trust in the electoral process. The commission proposed barring fugitive defendants and individuals convicted by the ICT from running in national elections or holding political party memberships.Â  It also recommended disqualifying individuals implicated in severe human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and assaults on journalists, as well as those convicted of corruption and money laundering by bodies such as the Anti-Corruption Commission or the International Criminal Court.Â  These measures would require special legislation to be implemented. Currently, individuals convicted of a criminal offense involving moral turpitude and sentenced to at least two years in prison are barred from contesting elections unless five years have passed since their release.Â  However, many bypass this restriction by filing appeals in higher courts.Â  The commission suggested closing this loophole by enforcing disqualifications immediately upon conviction, regardless of pending appeals. It also emphasized the need to disqualify elected representatives who submit false or incomplete information in their affidavits. The report proposed abolishing multiple candidacies by a single individual and replacing the requirement of signatures from 1% of voters for independent candidates with the support of 500 voters. To strengthen the Election Commission, the commission proposed enacting legislation to establish a permanent national constitutional council responsible for appointing members to the Election Commission and other constitutional bodies.Â  This council would ensure greater transparency and impartiality in the selection process.Â  Other recommendations included granting the Election Commission the authority to suspend or cancel elections in cases of malpractice, appoint its secretaries independently, and delay elections for up to 90 days during anticipated crises, provided there is unanimous approval.Â  The commission also recommended that the Election Commission declare the credibility of elections within 48 hours of results, enabling aggrieved parties to file appeals with the Constitutional Council or the Appellate Division.Â  It urged the creation of a specialized cadre for Election Commission officials to ensure professionalism and independence in election management. The report emphasized stricter regulations for political party operations. It called for publishing the list of general party members online, electing committees at all levels through secret ballots, and prohibiting auxiliary organizations under parties, such as student or labor wings.Â  It also suggested banning political parties from maintaining foreign branches.Â  Parliamentary candidates, according to the recommendations, must have been party members for at least three years, and party registration should be renewed every five years.Â  The provision that cancels a partyâs registration for failing to participate in two consecutive elections was recommended for repeal. The commission advocated for introducing a âno-voteâ provision, which would allow voters to reject all candidates in a constituency.Â  It also recommended mandatory verification of candidates' affidavits, disclosure of overseas assets, monitoring of election expenditures, and abolishing the use of Electronic Voting Machines.Â  Additionally, it suggested extending the scrutiny period for nomination papers, reducing campaign periods, and promoting alternative campaign methods such as leaflets, face-to-face voter interactions, and equal access to state media for campaigning. To address systemic issues, the commission proposed establishing an investigative body to determine accountability for irregularities in the 2018 elections.Â  It also recommended conducting local government elections on a non-partisan basis ahead of national elections and ensuring voting rights for expatriates through postal ballots or online voting systems.Â  The report further emphasized the need for structural changes, such as limiting the tenure of the prime minister, reforming the presidential election process, introducing an upper house in Parliament, holding direct elections for reserved womenâs seats, and reinstating the caretaker government system to oversee elections.",election

Other recommendations include defense division in the definition of law enforcement agencies for election time, prioritizing the Election Commissionâs own officials in appointment as returning officers and assistant returning officers, and changing a provision for an independent candidate to acquire support from 500 voters instead of submitting signatures of 1% of the voters.

He made this remark on Sunday afternoon, following the 14th commission meeting of the EC. He said: ""Our overall focus is on the national election. The commission is moving towards the national election. Once preparations for the national election are completed, other preparations will also fall into place."" After the nearly three-hour-long meeting, EC Sanaullah said: ""It's not just about holding elections. In the changed circumstances, the reality is that a reform commission is working. Their proposals will come forward. If any amendments to laws and regulations are needed based on these proposals, there is time to make those adjustments. The electoral environment in the country is a significant issue."" The EC added: ""Subsequently, to hold the national election, we will need considerable time. It would not be appropriate to introduce any event that could disrupt the national election. In this context, I am confident that the concerned ministry, the government, and all stakeholders will make decisions accordingly, and we will implement them. If the government feels that some elections should be held earlier, we will act accordingly."" He further said: ""However, if the government decides to conduct all elections simultaneously, our position is that this would not be appropriate. To facilitate updates, voter information collection from households will formally commence on January 20."" Commenting on the national ID card (NID) services, he said: ""We believe that transferring the NID services to the Ministry of Home Affairs is contradictory to the Constitution. The NID database was developed by the commission, and for this reason, it is not logical to transfer the NID operations to another department. We have decided to correspond on this matter.""",election

The meeting began at Nirbachan Bhaban in Dhaka at 11am on Sunday. The law, titled National Identity Registration Act 2023, was enacted by the Sheikh Hasina-led government. According to the law, NID operations were to be transferred from the EC to the Security Services Division under the Ministry of Home Affairs. However, at the time, the government issued a notification allowing the NID services to remain under the EC until the transfer process to the Security Services Division was completed. As of now, the NID services are still under the EC. The law has faced opposition from various quarters since its inception. Prominent figures and members of the public have consistently demanded that the NID services remain under the EC. They argue that the 2023 law should either be repealed or amended to ensure that NID services remain under the EC rather than being transferred to the Security Services Division. On Sunday's meeting, the EC is set to review the NID law and also discuss other issues, such as the use of a Special Information Form (additional information to Form-2) for voter registration in special areas (Chattogram region) and the adjustment of the EC Secretariat's manpower structure and equipment. This is the second meeting of the Election Commission led by AMS Nasir Uddin since taking office on November 21.

The process involves direct opinion exchanges, online feedback collection, and a nationwide survey conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics. These efforts have revealed several pressing issues, such as problems related to salaries and allowances of employees at various levels, power imbalances between members and chairpersons, and instances of irregularities and corruption. Additionally, the commission has received a range of recommendations, including determining academic qualifications for members, councilors, and mayors, abolishing the use of party symbols in local elections, and reducing interference from Members of Parliament (MPs) in local polls. Opinions on the parliamentary versus presidential systems of governance, unified local government laws, simplifying election procedures, and addressing financial corruption and nomination trading during elections were also collected. Some recommendations even touched on whether local polls should precede national elections or be held simultaneously.

The exhibition showcases almost 30 acrylic works on board paper, offering viewers a glimpse into the artistâs latest explorations. The artist Kazi Salahuddin Ahmed has lived through the 1971 war and, even today, continues to witness devastation in regions such as Syria, Russia, Kashmir, and Myanmarâdestruction that is entirely man-made. These tragedies, driven by the pursuit of power and control, have profoundly shaped his worldview. Over the decades, these experiences have left a lasting impression on his artistic journey, influencing both the themes and emotional depth of his work. Art critic Mustafa Zaman shared his impressions of the exhibition, âOf Real and Emotional Debris: The complete eraser of Gaza which was once full of life, the continued miseries of people in Kashmir, or the hopelessness faced by the displaced Rohingyas trying eke out a life in camps in Chattogram, all this jostle the mind as one tries hard to think of the future of the human race. It is also hard to leave behind the legacy of Bangladeshâs multiple failures in sculpting a future. Here the peopleâs dream for political stability has always remained a chimera. The fall of the repressive regime has certainly made way for all to focus on a future beyond the given structure, but it seems that things keep falling apart and we are only left with emotional debris.

Speaking about his character, Mosharraf Karim said, âThis is my first large-scale collaboration with Amitabh Reza, and I was drawn to the story and the character from the start. Iâve had a long-standing relationship with hoichoi, and my expectations for this series are high. I believe audiences will find something truly fresh and entertaining in Bohemian Ghora.â 'Bohemian Ghora', a hoichoi Original, also features Runa Khan in a pivotal role. While she has appeared in several previous hoichoi titles, her character in this series stands out as bold, confident, and hot-tempered a striking contrast to her earlier roles. Tanzika Amin plays a character that is quite the opposite of her real-life persona. Mousumi Hamid will be seen as a female honey collector, while Sadia Ayman brings to life a spirited, energetic young woman. Jui Karim appears in a completely new light. Farhana Hamid, her performance brings quiet strength and subtle emotion, leaving a lasting impression, and the series also marks the debut of two new faces â Aditi and Brishti. Director Amitabh Reza Chowdhury brings his storytelling finesse to this project. Sharing his thoughts, he said, âBohemian Ghora tells the humorous yet complex tale of how Abbas juggles love, expectations, and suspicion â all while on a road full of adventures. Everyone who acted in this series is dear to me. It was a fantastic journey for all of us, and now weâre eagerly waiting to see how the hoichoi audience receives Bohemian Ghora.â",showtime

The trailer of the series directed by Syed Ahmed Shawki was released on the night of May 8. We can see, the heirs get involved in various conflicts after the death of their father. Through such incidents the familyâs perfect image begins to crack. After 'Taqdeer' and 'Karagar', Shawki has moved forward with the story of a family in his third series, but he has kept conflict and mystery in it. Maruf Pratik is the writer of the story, dialogues, and screenplay of 'Gulmohor' along with the director. Why is the story of the family that the two have written together different from other family stories? Explaining that, Shawki said, 'Family crisis means division of property, quarrels among themselves, mistrust. My story has these. But what is more important or what I think makes this story different is the description of the dark side of the ancestors that the heirs have to carry.' Citing the examples of the series 'Taqdeer' and 'Karagar', Shawki said that he loves telling stories through the eyes of people who are outcasts from society. There is also a hint of this in the trailer of 'Gulmohar'. The series attempts to bring back a character and present social reality to the audience through his eyes. A rumor is doing the rounds on social media about the 'Gulmohar' series and Syed Ahmed Shawki. 'Gulmohar' is Shawki's largest-scale work as a director so far. The director has admitted the truth of this statement. But how can it be understood that it is a large-scale work? Explaining, Shawki said, ""In the case of fiction, large-scale work can depend on production design. 'Gulmohar' is such a fiction. However, when I say large-scale, I give the most importance to character design."" Shawki said, ""I have previously told the story of a single protagonist. But in the 'Gulmohar' series, there are many characters. Each character has different characteristics, different crises, different layers, different levels. It took a long time to write it, and the production design also had to be done on a large scale. So 'Gulmohar' is my largest-scale work."" Sara Zaker plays the role of Siraj's mother, and Intekhab Dinar, Sushama Sarkar, and Mir Naufel Ashrafi Jisan play the roles of siblings. Intekhab Dinar plays the role of the elder brother. He recently returned from abroad. Naturally, Intekhab Dinar's character goes through this personal family crisis. Sushama Sarkar plays the role of the sister, her character's name is Rehnuma. He said, ""'Gulmohar' is another addition to my acting career. Starting from the rehearsals, the entire process was great. Rehnuma or Renu is such a character that when you see her, you feel like she is a very familiar character, and then she becomes a little stranger somewhere. She repeatedly searches for the melody of her family relationship."" Mir Naufel Ashrafi Jisan played the role of Rabi. He said, ""Here, I feel like a family member with everyone else, that was my effort in acting and presence."" The character of Shanta, which is also a language, has been portrayed in the series. This character is played by Sarika Sabah. She said about her character, ""For this character, suffering is easy and love is a burden. I think many will see themselves in the character of Shanta."" Father, husband, son, brother and political leader - the character of Rana is played by Mostafizur Noor Imran. The actor said, ""This character has a legacy and tradition is very important to him. He is very reserved, does not share his thoughts or plans with others and ends up lost in his own thoughts."" Mostafizur Noor Imran said that one has to watch the series to know whether the character is good or bad. For Saswata Chatterjee, this is the first web series in Bangladesh.",showtime

https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/380197/from-comilla-to-cannes,Haru's journey from Comilla to Cannes,"03 May 2025, 10:29 PM","Haru is helping the Bangladeshi film industry reach new heights Haru, a film student from SAFTI (Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute), is the editor of the short film ""A Doll Made Up Of Clay,"" which has been officially selected to compete at the Cannes Film Festival. From using art as a form of escapism to accomplishing his dreams, he is only at the beginning of his journey and has already done what others can only dream off. In an interview with Dhaka tribune, he helped us dive into in thoughts and talked about his dreams and experience. How did you get into filmmaking? In 2012, I got into college, Birshrestha Noor Mohammad Public College. My family shifted from Comilla to Dhaka at that time and I really couldn't match up with the Dhaka boys and wanted to find some form of art as a form of escapism. Reading books, writing stories, watching films and then altogether I got interested in writing film scripts. I started watching a lot of films via the suggestions of the film groups of Facebook such as 'Cinemakhor', 'Cinemakhorder adda' and by watching films I felt like I too can make films and then I wanted to study more about it. Then in 2015 I got into theÂ  Television and Film Studies of University of Dhaka and now I am here. Â  What is your prior experience in this field? In 2016 I started working as an AD for Sankha Dasgupta and Ahmed Hasan Sunny for a few days. They together had a production house back then, I am sorry I forgot the name of it. And then in 2018, I became an intern AD for Half Stop Down under the supervision of Amitabh Reza Chowdhury. I couldn't stay there for long either as my studies were hampering. I shot, edited and directed a film named 'MRP', which got selected at Nepal's Ekadeshma International Film Festival's 'Made in Bangladesh' corner. Among the 12 films that got selected, I was the youngest director at that time. The same film was selected at the International Film Festival of South Asia, Toronto, Canada in 2018. I made this film inside my own room at Dhaka, just by following my brother. The film cost was literally nothing. And after coming here in our first year, everyone has to direct at least one film, I too made one, which got selected at IIUSFF, Dhaka and later at Dhaka Intl. Film Festival, but I had to withdraw the selection as they needed Bangladesh Premiere status, which I didn't have as I already screened my film at IIUSFF, Dhaka. Â  How did SAFTI help you in this journey? SRFTI has a beautiful campus I must say. Kolkata already has a lot less noise than Dhaka and SRFTI campus have even lesser sound pollution. So it helps us to think about our stories and discuss among the people who come from different parts of the world. Even in India there are lots of languages among them. Hearing those languages, their stories sort of trigger our memories of similar sorts of stories which help us write better scripts I feel. Other than that, SRFTI has really good technical departments. Editing, Cinematography, Sound - these three departments are equipped with the best possible equipment along with the very talented teachers. As the teachers are already established filmmakers, this encourages us even more. Â  What does the Cannes selection mean for Bangladeshi films? I think all the film students, film enthusiasts who are a bit skeptical about if they should join the journey of filmmaking, this news should inspire and encourage them. I personally have been discouraged a lot for getting into filmmaking yet I stuck onto it hoping one day I might get success. I didn't keep myself occupied into the typical TVC syndicate area. I studied more, I continuously tried for more and eventually I got this. This took me a lot of patience, suffering, tolerating everyone else's comment but yeah, I was committed on my journey. Still a lot of journeys need to be covered. I am yet to work on a proper good feature film. I have my own stories to tell, so I am hoping to start on my feature film script as well, as soon as possible. Other than me, there are three more Bangladeshi students studying here in my batch, together I think we can help, encourage and inspire any newcomer who is passionate about filmmaking. Â  What advice would you give someone who wants to pursue this line of work? Keep patience and also there was a viral folk song which had two lines that's very much needed in this field. ""O manush, manush, tomar duto kana ar duto chokh. Dekhba ar shunba.Kintu ekta much toh, ektu kotha kom koba"" (translation: Oh human, human you have two ears and two eyes. You see and hear. But you have one mouth, you speak a little less."") Rather than talking a lot, people need to listen and observe more. Not just other people, knowing your own self is the hardest and most important to understand other's emotions. Only after that we can form our own stories. Other than that, it's not always needed to work with expensive film cameras, sound devices or editing software. Everyone has a smartphone these days, if someone wants to make a film, just take out your phone and start shooting like the way you always wanted to. Then try to make a narrative out of those footage in the editing table. And the sound too may follow or not follow the footage all the time. This should be the filmmaker's own creative choice. In our leisure time we have made films in this way and those too got selected into foreign film festivals. Obviously those are not something like Cannes, but we kept on our practices which eventually led us to the one from which we are getting the recognition, finally. With his wealth of knowledge and such nuanced perspective on the world, art creators like him give the future generations hope and drive. Itâs only a matter of time he reaches new heights.",showtime

For some time now, Â Chorki has been planning to create opportunities for new and young filmmakers. The platform's CEO, Redoan Rony, said, ""Usually, it is seen that short films made by young people are focused on film festivals or have to be shown to a specific audience. After that, there is no way to show or watch them. Chorki's initiative is to create that opportunity."" Chorki's Lead Business and Growth Faisal Rahman confirmed that this effort will continue with young producers and artists. He said, ""In addition to encouraging the youth and recognizing their work, we want to create new audiences."" Chorki's Creative Producer Al-Amin Hasan Nirjhar said that they have selected 5 short films with different stories and production styles from many short films. The teasers of the short films have already been released online. Viewers expressed their appreciation and good wishes in the comments section. The short film âin the skyâ is a dramatic-comedy. The story is about a young man named Nuruddin's dream of going to the sky. Its director Ahsan Samran said, 'My film Akashe (In The Sky) has been released on Chorki, I have no happier news than this. I respect this initiative of Chorki. It will inspire many new filmmakers like me to do great work.' The short film 'Subrata Sengupta' is based on the screenplay of the late filmmaker Tarek Masud. Director Abir Ferdous Mukhar said, 'I was fortunate to work at the Tarek Masud Memorial Trust for a few days. That's where I first came across this screenplay. We started this work with the permission of Catherine Masud. We have added our own ideas while maintaining the atmosphere of the original script.' This short film gradually reveals how various factors such as family, society, love, religion, and politics influenced Subrata Sengupta's life in the late nineties. 'The Sky Gets Gloomy at Night' is a short drama . Its director Mahmudul Hasan Adnan said, ""After almost three years of making, my work 'The Sky Gloomy at Night' is going to reach everyone through Chorki. Which is a moment of great joy for me. I hope that the release of my film will lead me to the next film."" Due to unwanted mistakes and betrayals, a cruel reality descends on Beaver's personal, family and social life. From there, âEevival' is made about the story of starting over. Its director Mahmud Hasan said, 'I feel quite confident in giving Chorki the responsibility of showing the face of my first child in front of the audience.' The story of 'The Home in Sound' is built on the difficult struggle between friendship and dreams and reality. Its director Fuad said, ""Our journey is mainly in the coastal region where we wanted to say, the sea that saves our lives, the sea that consumes our lives. Our film was released on Chorki and I think Chorki is going to start a new journey for short films in Bangladesh.""",showtime

Survival through teamwork: It's a tale as old as time with particular resonance today, says Argentine actor Ricardo Darin of his latest project ""The Eternaut,"" which hit Netflix on Wednesday. Â  Based on a 1950s comic with iconic status in the South American country, the sci-fi series tells the story of a mysterious, toxic snowfall that precedes an alien invasion of Buenos Aires. Â  More elementally, it is about ordinary people with few resources and no special powers who collectively stare down a totalitarian threat, Darin, 68, told AFP in an interview. Â  ""The communities that managed to survive were those that stood shoulder to shoulder, defended themselves, and did not care only about what happened to them individually,"" he said of the storyline. Â  In this way, the series ""resonates"" with the present, said Darin, though he declined to specify which threat in particular he was referring to. Â  Directed and scripted by Argentina's Bruno Stagnaro, ""The Eternaut"" is based on the comic by the same name serialized by writer Hector Oesterheld and illustrator Francisco Solano Lopez between 1957 and 1959. Â  Oesterheld took the series up again in the 1960s, with ever-more political overtones that are believed to have contributed to his kidnapping in 1977 under Argentina's brutal military dictatorship. Â  He was never heard from again, nor were his four daughters and three sons-in-law, all of whom figure among the estimated 30,000 people listed as ""disappeared"" by agents of the dictatorship, according to rights groups. Â  - 'Very, very hard work' - Darin, known for his roles in the films ""Nine Queens,"" ""Wild Tales,"" and ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" -- which won the Oscar for best international feature in 2010 -- said he was scared at first of playing Juan Salvo, the resistance hero in ""The Eternaut."" Â  He had no background in science fiction and had to do demanding stunts. Â  ""Physically it was very, very hard work,"" the actor said. Â  ""Each day, the end of filming found us exhausted, and with little recovery time."" Â  Darin took part in 113 of the 148 days of shooting, often decked out in Salvo's heavy snow-proof outfit on sets covered with tons of cumbersome artificial snow. Â  ""Not to mention the things that happen in an action shoot, where you have to roll, jump, fall, crash, fight; a series of things that when you're 25 or 30 years old, it's nothing, but for me, who is 114..."" he laughed. Â  Darin is hopeful the series will be a boost for Argentine cinema at a time the government of budget-slashing President Javier Milei has withdrawn state support for the National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts, and for culture in general. Â  ""Nothing like this has ever been done here,"" said Darin of the project.",showtime

Bangladeshi one-shot film Not a Fiction, directed by emerging filmmaker Shah Newaz Khan Cju, has clinched the Best Super Short Film Award at the prestigious Prague Film Festival 2025. Following its successful journey through three Oscar and two Canadian Screen Awards-qualifying festivals, this critically acclaimed short stands as a powerful historical document, highlighting the countless extrajudicial killings across Bangladesh over the past two decades. Czech capital â is ranked as Eastern Europeâs premier film festival by FilmFreeway. Among 3,266 submissions from 95 countries, only 72 films were officially selected, with Not a Fiction standing out as the sole representative from South Asia. On the night of April 26, during the festivalâs gala event, the awards were announced, with Not a Fiction winning the Best Super Short Film Award. This yearâs jury included GUNNUR MARTINSDÃTTIR SCHLÃTER, winner of the Special Mention at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival (Palme d'Or Shorts Competition), and Polish filmmaker ELÅ»BIETA BENKOWSKA, whose film Olena was an Official Selection at Cannes in 2013. The win also marked the filmâs European premiere, making a significant statement on the global stage about Bangladeshâs ongoing human rights concerns. Director Shah Newaz Khan Cju, who traveled to Prague to accept the award, shared his excitement in a press statement from Berlin, where he is currently based. âThis is my first major international award, and honestly, Iâm still in disbelief. Itâs a matter of immense pride to bring this honor home from Kafkaâs city,â he said. He further added, ""One of the jury members shared something that touched me deeply â Not a Fiction was competing head-to-head with another highly talked-about European film, which had a production budget of around 50,000 Euros.

In its 47th edition, Bangladeshi film âMastulâ has received widespread praise and the Special Mention (Jury) award. On Tuesday, âMastulâ had its world premiere in Moscow, where both international film critics and general audiences were present. The filmâs premiere was attended by the director Mohammad Nuruzzaman, cinematographer Mohammad Arifuzzaman, and the two lead actors, Fazlur Rahman Babu and Deepak Suman. After the screening, the Mastul team was showered with congratulations and best wishes from the audience. Later, film critics and discerning viewers asked insightful questions about various aspects of the film. For several years now, Bangladeshi films, including Adim and Nirvana, have regularly featured in the main competition section of the Moscow Film Festival. However, the team behind Mastul expressed that the overwhelming response they received from the Moscow audience on Tuesday night was the greatest reward. The lead actors, Fazlur Rahman Babu and Deepak Suman, were deeply moved by the love shown by the audience and critics alike. Babu expressed his feeling of being âfortunateâ to attend the festival, saying, âAttending such a grand festival in Moscow is a privilege for anyone, and I feel lucky to be here with the film I acted in. I also consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to be a part of this film.â The veteran actor further commented, âGetting a spot in Moscow's main competition section is a matter of great pride not just for the Mastul team but also for Bangladesh and independent filmmakers.â Actor Deepak Suman, too, expressed his excitement, saying, âItâs a great honor for me to be here in Moscow thanks to Mastul. The reaction from the audience at the premiere was beyond my expectations.â He added, âThe audience observed everything so perfectly that one foreign viewer even asked me if I really work on a ship! The way the audience and critics responded to the film is definitely a major achievement for me.â Cinematographer Arifuzzaman was equally astonished by the keen observation of the audience. He said, âIn Moscow, I noticed that everyone watches the film with great attention. I realized this during the âMeet the Pressâ event, where journalists and critics asked so many detailed questions about Mastul. The fact that they paid such attention to every little detail is something I consider a significant achievement.â Since arriving in Moscow on April 21, director Mohammad Nuruzzaman has been engaging with the festival organizers, giving interviews, and answering questions from journalists and the audience after the filmâs premiere. Previously, he had attended the festival with the film Adim as a co-producer, but this time heâs there with his own directed film, which has made the experience even more special. Nuruzzaman expressed his satisfaction with the festivalâs projection system: âThe screens were so impressive, and the sound delivery during the Mastul premiere was exactly as I had hoped. Having worked on the sound in South India for this film, seeing it presented so perfectly in Moscow was incredibly satisfying.â At the premiere in Moscow, not only foreign viewers but also many expatriate Bangladeshis attended. After watching the film, they remarked that Mastul, with its cultural diversity, human emotions, and reflection of reality, was able to win the hearts of Moscowâs audience. Moscow critics praised Mastul for its story, direction, and performances. Many viewers noted that the film is not just the story of one country but a universal human language that can touch people from any culture. Critics also praised the cinematography, music, and dialogues, which won over the hearts of Moscowâs film buffs. This achievement is not just for Mastul but also for the entire Bangladeshi film industry, marking a significant moment for the countryâs cinema. The enthusiastic response from Moscow proves that with a good story and skilled filmmaking, language or geographic boundaries are not obstacles. Mastul has crossed those boundaries and is now representing Bangladeshâs culture on the world stage. The awards were announced on April 24. The Mastul team is expected to return to Dhaka on April 26, provided everything goes as planned. The film Mastul, which is based on the story of sailors floating on the water, also features performances by Aminur Rahman Mukul, Arif Hasan, Sifat Bonya, and others. The digital distribution and promotion of the film are handled by Tonghor Taklies.",showtime

That day, at 8:45 am, the building named Rana Plaza collapsed in Savar, Dhaka. In this accident, 1,175 garment workers who were there were killed and more than two thousand people were injured. Like everyone else, director Kamar Ahmad Simon was tormented by the incident. The fast-paced life of people makes many catastrophies forgettable like turning the pages of a newspaper. Still, some incidents, haunt them for a long time. Kamar Ahmad Simon had been feeling that torment since the incident. After the Rana Plaza tragedy, he could not sit still and made âTestimony of a Threadâ in 2015. According to the director, âI made the film at the expense of a citizenâ. Over a decade after the Rana Plaza tragedy, âTestimony of a Threadâ will be released on Chorki on April 24. Viewers can watch âTestimony of a Threadâ on the OTT platform for free.Â  Kamar Ahmad Simon wanted to make a feature film about Rana Plaza. âTestimony of a Threadâ was made from his research material. Inspired by Akira Kurosawaâs âRashomonâ, âTestimony of a Threadâ is a 52-minute film. A monologue collage in an attempt to find the human face behind the most serious structural failure in modern history. Regarding the release of this film in Chorki, Kamar said, ""There are mixed feelings. Since Chorki is currently one of the main streaming platforms in the Bengali language, there is no better way to reach the Bengali-speaking audience at home and abroad. But at the same time, as a director, I also have a claim, the way the film is being celebrated around the world right nowâit seems that the audience is not being treated fairly. Also, since my film 'Another Day...' is coming up, I want to see how the audience of Chorki receives a demanding film like 'Testimony of a threadâ.â ' Testimony of a threadâ won the Asian Pitch Award in 2013. 'Monologue Collage', written and directed by Kamar Ahmad Simon, was produced by Sara Afreen. The film, by the production company Shuchan, was jointly produced by four of Asia's leading television networks â NHK (Japan), KBS (South Korea) , PTS (Taiwan) and Â Mediacorp (Singapore).",showtime

On Tuesday (April 22), the victim Pinky Akhter filed the case in the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Nazmin Akhter. The court took the plaintiff's statement, investigated the case and ordered the Police Bureau of Investigation (PBI) to submit a report by May 8. Plaintiff's lawyer Nasidus Zaman Nishan confirmed this information. A person named Sourav (28), who lives in the same flat with Pori Moni, has also been made an accused in the case. According to the charges in the case, Pinky took a job at the defendants' house through an organization called Quader Agency in March 2024. Before being hired, Pinky was supposed to take care of one child, but she had to take care of two children. She was also made to do the cooking at home at different times of the day and night. Since the job was absolutely necessary, the plaintiff was carrying out her duties with sincerity, accepting everything. However, on April 2 of this year at 1 pm, the accused Pori Moni came intoxicated from her makeup room to the child's room and started abusing Pinky in foul language. When asked about the reason for the abuse, Pori Moni said, ""Why are you making milk for my child, now you will give them solid food."" Pinky said, ""According to the child's eating routine, now they are supposed to be fed milk, so I made milk."" At that time, Pori Moni got angry and slapped the plaintiff indiscriminately on the head, face and eyes. At one stage, Pinky became unconscious. After regaining consciousness, she was terrified. In order to get to a safe place from the scene, the victim Pinky kept requesting Pori Moni to take her to the hospital. Accused No. 2 Sourav was present at the time of the incident. But the accused did not listen to her. In addition, accused Sourav encouraged Pori Moni to torture Pinky and prevented her from leaving the house. Later, Pinky called 999 and went to safety from the scene with the help of the police. She sought treatment at Kurmitola General Hospital in Dhaka. In this incident, the victim Pinky Akhter filed a general diary with Bhatara Police Station on April 4. Later, not seeing any progress in it, she filed a case in the court, which is also mentioned in the statement.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/379144/from-bangladesh-to-the-world-the-evolution-of,From Bangladesh to the world: The evolution of music releases,"21 Apr 2025, 03:59 PM","Much like global counterparts in the indie scenes of India, Nigeria or South Korea, Bangladeshi musicians now manage their own releases, coordinate with digital distributors and cultivate global audiences. In the 1990s and early 2000s, during the major religious festival of Eid in Bangladesh, a visit to any neighborhood market would reveal a vibrant cultural tradition: loudspeakers blasting newly released songs, children humming along and cassette or CD stalls crowded with eager buyers. Music was not just entertainment; it was a seasonal event, a communal expression of joy and celebration. Eid was the prime occasion for releasing new songs, and in many ways, it mirrored the global phenomenon of timed music dropsâwhether it was Christmas albums in the West or Diwali releases in India.Today, that scene is a memory.The gradual disappearance of Eid-specific music releases in Bangladesh isnât just about nostalgiaâitâs a reflection of how deeply the global music industryâs transformation has affected local markets. The journey of Bangladeshi musicâfrom cassettes to CDs, from radio to YouTube and now, from a domestic ritual to a digital global phenomenonâcaptures the profound shifts in music distribution and cultural consumption in the 21st century.The Cassette Boom: Bangladesh Joins the Global Tape CultureThe story of Bangladeshâs music industry as a commercial entity begins in 1982 with the release of the country's first audio cassette by Disco Recording. This mirrored a broader trend across Asia and Africa, where cassettes democratized music. Much like in Egypt, Nigeria and India, the cassette tape in Bangladesh empowered local musicians and regional languages, bringing music out of elite or state-controlled spaces and into peopleâs homes.In the ensuing years, artists like Kumar Bishwajit, M.A. Shoaeb, Runa Laila and Andrew Kishore began releasing non-film music, carving out a parallel ecosystem alongside the already vibrant world of film songs. Bands emerged. Labels flourished. An audio economy was born.By the 1990s, Bangladesh had its own bustling music industry that resembled the pop and rock booms of the UK in the '70s and '80sâonly with Bengali lyrics, regional roots and unique melodic signatures.The Rise of Bands and Mixed Albums: Local Innovation, Global InfluenceThe 1990s marked the golden age of Bangladeshi pop and rock, with bands like LRB, Miles, Feedback and Warfaze leading a cultural revolution. They were Bangladeshâs answer to Pink Floyd, Guns Nâ Roses and Queenânot in imitation, but in impact. LRBâs Ferari Mon (1996) or Milesâs Prottasha (1993) were not just chart-toppers; they were cultural landmarks, shaping youth identity and musical taste.Meanwhile, the concept of the âmixed albumââa compilation featuring multiple artists and composersâbecame a Bangladeshi innovation that drove market demand. Producers like Prince Mahmud turned these albums into blockbusters. This format, though similar in spirit to the Western âsoundtrack album,â was unique in its structure and local appeal.CD, Piracy, and the Digital CliffAs in much of the world, the early 2000s ushered in a rapid shift from analog to digital. CDs replace cassettes, but not for long. The onset of MP3 piracy, mobile phone ringtones, and file-sharing platforms disrupted the market just as it had in North America and Europeâonly without the cushion of robust copyright enforcement or diversified revenue streams.While giants like iTunes and Spotify began consolidating the global digital music economy, Bangladesh's music industry was left vulnerable. By 2010, most local audio labels had either shuttered or pivoted entirely to survive.Yet, amidst this disruption, creativity flourished. Artists like Habib Wahid and Fuad Al Muqtadir brought in a new soundâinfusing traditional melodies with modern electronic beats, a style that resonated with the Bangladeshi diaspora and global listeners alike.FM Radio and the DIY GenerationFrom 2007 to 2012, FM radio brought a renaissance, similar to the way college radio and indie stations shaped the alt-rock scene in the U.S. in the â90s. New voicesâTopu, Minar, Hridoy Khanâfound audiences, while bands like Artcell, Black, and Shironamhin cultivated loyal fanbases, much like indie rock bands in Seattle or Manchester once did.By the mid-2010s, Bangladeshâs artists, much like their counterparts across Latin America or Eastern Europe, began bypassing labels altogetherâembracing YouTube, Facebook and later, Spotify and Apple Music. Suddenly, the potential audience was no longer confined to Dhaka or Chattogram, but expanded to Bengali-speaking listeners in New York, London, Toronto and Sydney.A Streaming Story in Two RealitiesWhen Spotify finally launched in Bangladesh in 2021, it was a symbolic moment. Bangladeshi artists could now release their songs directly to the world. But the domestic music economy had already changed. The failure of local music streaming apps like GP Music and Robi Splash highlighted a stark reality: while the global infrastructure was now in place, local monetization remained a challenge.And yet, paradoxically, Bangladeshi music now travels farther than ever before.Independent artists and bandsâfrom Pritom Hasan and Masha to Ashes and Bangla Fiveâare gaining international visibility. Just as K-pop, Afrobeat and Punjabi hip-hop have leapt across linguistic and geographic boundaries, Bangla music too is finding its niche. Songs by Bangladeshi artists are being used in short films, remixes and reels by content creators across the globe.This is perhaps the most fascinating twist in the tale: even as the local infrastructure collapses, global platforms offer new lifelines.The New Global-Local ParadigmIn todayâs Bangladesh, the business model of music has changed. The big labels now focus more on YouTube dramas and video content, using songs as marketing tools rather than cultural products. But this shift mirrors broader global trends, where music is often a complement to larger digital ecosystemsâused to enhance branding, build followers and attract streams.Meanwhile, artists have turned into entrepreneurs. Much like global counterparts in the indie scenes of India, Nigeria or South Korea, Bangladeshi musicians now manage their own releases, coordinate with digital distributors and cultivate global audiences.A Festival Without Songs?It is in this context that Eidâs musical silence becomes poignant. The festival, once synonymous with new music, now passes with only a handful of releases. Not because the artists have stopped creatingâbut because the infrastructure has changed. The neighborhood record shop is gone. The cassette is extinct. The local CD player was replaced by smartphones that connect to the world.And yet, thereâs hope.In the quiet, a new kind of music is emergingâborderless, hybrid, and personal. Itâs being recorded in bedrooms, produced on laptops, and released on streaming platforms that know no national boundaries.From Bangladesh to the world, the song goes on.

Â  The ""Firework"" and ""California Gurls"" singer was lofted more than 60 miles (100 kilometers) above the Earth's surface in a vessel from Blue Origin, the space company owned by the Amazon founder. Â  Five other women -- including Bezos's fiancee Lauren Sanchez -- were on the flight, which took off from western Texas shortly after 8:30 am (1330 GMT) before safely landing again some 10 minutes later. Â  The flight brought the passengers beyond the Karman line -- the internationally recognized boundary of space. Â  One of the other passengers, TV presenter Gayle King, said Perry sang ""What a wonderful world"" in space. Â  ""It's a 10 out of 10. That's my review. Definitely go for it,"" the singer said after she was safely back on Earth. Â  Their fully automated craft rose vertically before the crew capsule detached mid-flight, later falling back to the ground slowed by parachutes and a retro rocket. Â  The jubilant women then emerged, with Perry kissing the ground after exiting the capsule. Â  ""I think this experience has shown me you never know how much love is inside of you, like how much love you have to give and how loved you are until the day you launch,"" she said. Â  Monday's mission was the first all-woman space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963. Â  It is also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered space tourism experiences for several years. Â  The company does not publicly communicate the price of trips made possible by its New Shepard rocket. Â  They were expected to have a brief period when the women could unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity.

In addition to Bangladesh's 'Mastul', the festival will feature a total of 11 films from different countries including Russia, Korea, Spain, Argentina, Germany, and Turkey. On Wednesday, April 2, the festival authorities announced the details of the films in various categories of the festival, including the main competition section. Later, the details of the festival were also presented on the official website. Director Nuruzzaman is excited that 'Mastul' has made it to the main competition section at this prestigious festival. Expressing his joy, the producer said that the festival authorities had already confirmed the nomination of 'Mastul' in Moscow via e-mail. Since the festival authorities announced the names of the nominated films in all categories, including the main competition, at a press conference, it feels good to share this happy news of 'Mastul' with everyone. The festival authorities have already invited Team Mastul. The producer said that he plans to go to Moscow in mid-April to attend the festival. The film's poster was shared by the filmmaker on the day of âMastulâ being nominated in Moscow. The poster was created by talented artist Dhrubo Esh. âMastulâ has already been cleared to be released in the country. On March 24, âMastulâ received a clearance certificate from the Bangladesh Film Certification Board without any cuts. âMastulâ is suitable for viewers of all ages. In a press release, Nuruzzaman said about the background of the movie, âI was born and raised in Narayanganj. Since childhood, I have been watching the sailors of the river port area. The relationship between these people floating on the water and the ship and their diverse lives have always attracted me. âMastulâ gave me the opportunity to capture that life story in the camera frame.â Regarding the release of âMastulâ in the country, Mohammad Nuruzzaman said, âWe completed all the work on âMastulâ last year.

Â  Directed by Mehedi Hasan Hridoy, âBorbaadâ has taken the lead among this yearâs other major Eid releases â Afran Nisho starter 'Daagi', Siam Ahmed starrer 'Jongli', Mosharraf Karim starrer 'Chokkor 302', and Sajal-Nusraat Fariaâs 'Jinn-3' â earning Tk 28.82 lakh alone on its opening day, according to the Facebook-based movie enthusiast page BMR â Bangla Movie Review.

On the second day, demand surged, leading to a nearly 60% increase in showings, with 41 screenings held â 35 of which were houseful. By the end of the second day, its total multiplex earnings had climbed to approximately Tk 73.14 lakh, with Tk 44.31 lakh collected on the second day alone. Â  On Wednesday, the third day of Eid, Star Cineplex increased the number of screenings to 44, with 45 planned for Thursday across all of its branches nationwide. Â  Meanwhile, âAntorattaâ, directed by Wajed Ali Sumon, failed to gain traction. The film, which was released across 21 theatres, including multiplexes and single screens, saw disappointing ticket sales, leading to its removal from Star Cineplex within a day. Â  Initially scheduled for two daily screenings at the Bashundhara City and Sony Square branches of Star Cineplex until April 3, the film was dropped a day early due to poor audience turnout. Â  Starring Shakib Khan alongside Kolkata actress Darshana Banik, âAntorattaâ had originally been slated for release in 2022 but faced delays. Its low-key promotional campaign, coupled with minimal involvement from the cast, contributed to its lacklustre performance. Â  Following its removal from Star Cineplex, the film had two screenings at Lion Cinemas on Tuesday and is still showing at Blockbusters Cinemas in Jamuna Future Park. However, its total multiplex earnings over two days amounted to just Tk 1.27 lakh. Â  The stark contrast in performance between âBorbaadâ and âAntorattaâ has sparked debates among Bangladeshi cinephiles, with discussions on social media reflecting the evolving tastes of Bangla moviegoers.",showtime

I really did. The first few minutes had me hookedâruined cities stretching endlessly, mechanical giants lying broken in fields of overgrown weeds, and a lone girl walking through it all, accompanied by a group of robots and people. It looked like a masterpiece in the making. And then, slowly but surely, the feeling faded. With a budget of $320 million, The Electric State was a major Netflix production, directed by the Russo brothers and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Based on Simon Stalenhagâs graphic novel, it had all the ingredients for something groundbreaking. But the film struggles to connect on a deeper level. The story centers on Michelle (Millie Bobby Brown), a teenage orphan whose parents are dead and whose brother, Christopher (Woody Norman), is presumed dead. However, her life takes an unexpected turn when Cosmo (Alan Tudyk), a robot, arrives at her foster fatherâs home with a startling revelation that Christopher is alive and being held by tech mogul Ethan Skate (Stanley Tucci). Determined to rescue him, Michelle sets out on a perilous mission alongside Cosmo. Along the way, they cross paths with Keats (Chris Pratt), a small-time smuggler, and his robotic companion, Herman (Anthony Mackie). As they dig deeper, they uncover a connection between Christopherâs disappearance and Sentre, a dominant tech corporation run by the shrewd Ethan Skate. His revolutionary technology played a key role in humanityâs victory against the robots, leading to their exile in the exclusion zone. With Keats and the stranded robots as allies, Michelle takes on Ethanâs powerful empire to bring her brother home. The Electric State aimed to blend emotion with world-building in a way that could redefine sci-fi storytelling. Instead, Netflix delivered a movie that split audiencesâsome praising its artistry, others frustrated by its lack of depth. The blend of retro-futuristic technology with desolation makes for an arresting cinematic experience. But thatâs where the unanimous praise ends. Where The Electric State falters is in its emotional depth. The relationship between the people and robots, which should have been the heart of the film, feels distant and underwritten. There are moments of brillianceâfleeting glimpses of the deeper, more poignant story that could have beenâbut they are drowned out by a script that never quite finds its footing. The pacing drags and the emotional beats never fully land. What should have been a deeply affecting odyssey often feels more like a slow, scenic detour with no clear destination. One of the most frustrating aspects of The Electric State is how close it came to greatness. The pieces were all thereâan evocative world, a strong conceptual foundation, and an atmosphere thick with the weight of forgotten memories. And yet, the film feels strangely passive. It is something to watch, not something to feel.",showtime

Dhallywood actress Afia Nusrat Barsha recently announced her decision to quit acting, after returning from performing Umrah. She made the announcement at a press conference on Thursday (Mar 20), where her husband and co-actor Ananta Jalil was also present. Barsha clarified that she will complete her ongoing film projects before retiring from acting. âI still have a few films in hand, which will take some time to complete. But after that, I will not work in any new films,â she said at the press conference. Elaborating about the reason behind her decision, she explained, âI am a very realistic person. I believe actresses look good on screen only up to a certain age, and they should work within that limit; so I have decided to step away from films on my own.â Barsha also mentioned her children as a key factor in her decision. âMy eldest son is now 10 years old, and my youngest is 7. In a few years, when my eldest is 14 or 15, how will he feel knowing his mother is a film actress? Keeping that in mind, I made this decision.â Her husband, Ananta Jalil, has no objections to her decision. ""Barsha is still younger than many leading actresses in our industry: yet, she has chosen to step away on her own,"" he said at the press conference. Barsha made her big-screen debut in 2010 with the film 'Khoj: The Search'. She gained popularity by starring in multiple films opposite his husband, Ananta Jalil. The couple got married on September 23, 2011, and they have two sons - Ariz Ibn Jalil and Abrar Ibn Jalil. With this decision, Barsha is set to end her long career in the film industry. It remains to be seen whether she will stay entirely away from showbiz or remain involved in some other capacity.",showtime

https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/376255/a-bittersweet-memoir-we-live-in-time,We Live in Time: A bittersweet memoir,"14 Mar 2025, 01:40 PM","At its core, this film serves as a reminder to cherish the little moments and appreciate the people in our lives Helmed by John Crowley, We Live in Time (2024) is a film that gracefully intertwines elements of melodrama with the essence of a romantic comedy. With two brilliant actorsâAndrew Garfield and Florence Pugh, this film initially presents itself as a lighthearted love story. However, beneath its seemingly simple exterior lies a deeply moving narrative that delves into the complexities of love, loss, and the weight of time. Florence Pugh plays Almut, a chef at a restaurant, while Andrew Garfield portrays Tobias, a representative at a food company. Together, they navigate the joys of life and parenthood while raising their daughter, Ella. Nevertheless, the film takes a poignant turn when Almut is diagnosed with Stage 3 ovarian cancer, forcing them to confront the harsh realities of time slipping away. While We Live in Time fits within the rom-com genre, it stands apart by weaving in profound themes that go beyond the usual lighthearted tropes. The film doesnât shy away from tackling difficult subjectsâterminal illness, the decision of whether or not to have children, and the emotional burden of watching a loved one fade away. One of the most striking aspects of the film is how it realistically captures emotions. The dialogues are simple yet powerful, allowing the audience to connect deeply with the charactersâ experiences. The performances by Garfield and Pugh are particularly commendable, as they bring raw authenticity to every scene. For anyone who has lost a loved one to cancer, the film is especially moving. It serves as a reminder to cherish the little moments and appreciate the people in our lives. Through Almut and Tobias, the film paints a picture of a couple who, despite the impending loss, choose to find beauty in their time together rather than succumb to despair. A notable strength of We Live in Time is its depiction of a mature relationship based on communication and mutual support. Almut and Tobias do not let their struggles drive them apart, instead, they confront each challenge together. Whether itâs dealing with the stress of Almutâs diagnosis or making life-altering decisions, they engage in honest conversationsâsomething that is rarely portrayed in films today. Their dynamic is a refreshing take on modern relationships, emphasizing that love is not just about romance but also about standing by one another in the toughest times. At the heart of the film is the idea of living in the moment. Almut is given the option to undergo surgery for her tumor, but with no guarantee that it will prevent the cancer from spreading or ultimately leading to her demise. Despite this, she chooses to forgo the procedure. She decides to spend quality time with her family, making the most of the time she has left. As a chef, cooking is the one thing Almut can still control. She pours all her energy into perfecting her craft, ultimately earning a place in the prestigious Bocuse d'Orâthe Olympics of the culinary world. However, fate presents her with a difficult choiceâthe competition falls on the same day as her wedding. With only a limited amount of time left, she must decide between chasing her professional dream or spending one of her final days celebrating her love with Tobias and Ella. Almutâs struggle is a reflection of what countless women experienceâwanting to build a meaningful career while also being present for their loved ones. Her choice to pursue the competition highlights her determination to leave behind a legacy beyond being a wife and mother. She refuses to let her illness define her existence and instead chooses to be remembered for her strength, ambition, and passion. The film employs a non-linear storytelling approach, reflecting the unpredictable nature of life and love, while adding a layer of realism that mirrors the fragmented nature of human memory and experience. The structure of the film, which shifts between different points in time, reflects the experience of life flashing before oneâs eyes. The first 10-15 minutes may seem disjointed, but as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that this technique serves a greater purposeâcapturing the essence of time and how we live within it. We Live in Time takes audiences on an emotional journey through the highs and lows of love and loss, reminding us to appreciate the beauty in everyday life.",showtime

https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/375978/nadaaniyan-and-the-death-of-rom-coms,Nadaaniyan and the death of rom-coms,"11 Mar 2025, 02:29 PM","Khushi and Ibrahimâs acting was a trainwreck, but the real villains are the writers and directors who botched the execution of the entire project I watched Nadaaniyan immediately after it dropped on Netflix a few days ago, and I knew I was walking into a mess, but hey, at least I thought I'd get some mindless entertainment out of it. It turned out to be way worse than that.Â  Letâs get one thing straight: itâs not just the nepo kidsâ fault here. We canât just blame Khushi Kapoor and Ibrahim Ali Khan for this hot mess. The real villain is the appalling execution of the entire project. Did the writers even use more than two brain cells to cook this? Itâs hard to believe otherwise. More compelling plots have emerged in peopleâs late-night, sleep-deprived daydreams. The whole ""fake boyfriend"" trope has been done before and done well! To All the Boys Iâve Loved Before is proof that this tired cliche can still slap when executed right. But Nadaaniyan? It takes this trope, throws it headfirst into a brick wall, and calls it a day. It doesn't just fail to capture its audience; it doesn't even try. The storyline (if we can even call it that) revolves around Pia and Arjun. These characters could not be more two-dimensional. Pia is a cardboard cutout of a rich girl with daddy issues. Arjun, on the other hand, is supposedly ""intelligent,"" but nothing on screen suggests heâs capable of stringing together a coherent thought. Apparently we're supposed to believe he's a genius just because he has abs. Together, they create something that cannot be called chemistry, that definitely transcends cringe. For whatever reason, Khushi and Ibrahimâs voices were dubbed, evidently out of sync. Itâs 2025, and if a team cannot sync audios properly, itâs simply just lazy work. The entire production (from the plot to the camerawork) was like watching a slow-motion car crash. Painful and impossible to look away from. Which brings me to the burning question: What happened to good rom-coms? When we were growing up, Bollywood served us Jab We Met and Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na; actual rom-com royalty! Now? Either I am too old, or the genre has headed straight into the abyss of mediocrity. jwARI.fetch( $( ""#ari-image-jw6829e46b5ca10"" ) ); Netflixâs Mismatched (which they try to brand as ""funny"" and ""charming"") managed to keep me hooked for three seasons. Was it great? No. Was it guilty pleasure trash I couldn't stop watching? Absolutely. But one has to admit that Mismatched was a misstep. Take Anmol and Vinny, or Sid and Zeenat - great stories, totally overshadowed by Rishi and Dimple, the main characters who have about as much on-screen chemistry as two damp towels, which is ironic considering their off-screen dynamic is supposedly electric. Their on-again, off-again relationship is so insufferable, itâs like even the audience is ready to give up. And itâs not just Bollywood suffering from this rom-com curse. Western shows and movies are no better. XO, Kitty (a spin-off of To All The Boys, which was arguably one of the best rom-coms in recent memory) feels like its own unique brand of chaos. The whole first season was so ridiculously bad that I found myself laughing through most of it.Â  Honestly, Iâve never seen anyone as indecisive as Kitty. She switched romantic interests faster than we swapped out outfits. What happened to the sassy, self-assured Kitty we all fell in love with from Lara Jeanâs story? Gone. Vanished. Sheâs a completely different person here, with horrible acting as well by the way.Â  jwARI.fetch( $( ""#ari-image-jw6829e46b5ca30"" ) ); The list of Netflix rom-com flops is so long. The Perfect Date, The Kissing Booth, Sierra Burgess Is a Loser, Holidate - each one a new level of disappointment. Itâs like rom-com creators are playing a sick game of âhow low can we go?â Every story follows the same tired formula: a ""meet cute"" that isn't cute, followed by unnecessary melodrama. What we need are fresh narratives, not the same old tropes like the fake boyfriend or manic pixie dream girl. Also, the superficial relationships weâre forced to endure. Itâs like rom-com writers have a personal vendetta against letting their characters actually bond. Can we, for once, let the main characters talk to each other? The creators also seem to think that tossing in a few Gen Z buzzwords like 'slay' or 'rizz' makes them instantly relatable. Spoiler: it doesnât. Weâre more than just a checklist of internet trends and slapstick jokes. How about bringing back the smart, subtle humor that made the genre feel authentic instead of treating us like we only speak in memes.Â  And where are the good characters? Geet from Jab We Met is still iconic because she was unapologetically herself, even within the manic pixie dream girl trope. We need more characters who feel real, relatable, and human. Instead, we get cardboard cutouts who are so forgettable I can barely recall their names after the credits roll.Â  Coming back to Nadaaniyan: Sure, Khushi and Ibrahim's acting was a disaster, but Iâm not holding it against them. After all, even Alia Bhatt had a cringe-worthy start in Student of the Year, but now she has truly grown as an artist. My real beef is with the writers and directors. Itâs hard to believe actual professionals were involved. When you create something, your passion should shine through, whether itâs a fluffy romance or a gritty drama. Instead, this storyline felt like it was put together during a game of story chain with friends who stopped caring three rounds in. In the end, the future of rom-coms is on life support. If filmmakers donât start treating this genre with genuine effort and passion, we might as well kiss it goodbye. Or maybe we already have.",showtime

Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman died of natural causes about a week after his wife's death, a medical examiner said Friday, ending more than a week of mystery surrounding the death of one of Hollywood's most beloved stars. The bodies of ""The French Connection"" star and his wife were found on February 26 in their home in New Mexico after emergency services were called to their property. ""The cause of death for Mr. Gene Hackman, aged 95 years, is hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor,"" Heather Jarrell, the chief medical examiner for the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, told reporters. ""The cause of death for Miss Betsy Hackman, aged 65 years, is hantavirus, pulmonary syndrome. The manner of death is natural."" Neither body showed any sign of trauma, nor any indication of carbon monoxide poisoning, which had been an initial suggestion. Hantavirus presents as a flu-like disease, with symptoms including fever, muscle aches, cough, sometimes vomiting and diarrhea that can progress to shortness of breath and cardiac or heart failure and lung failure, Jarrell said. ""This occurs after a one- to eight-week exposure to excrement from a particular mouse species that carries hantavirus."" Jarrell said data from Hackman's pacemaker showed its last activity over a week before his body was found when maintenance workers were unable to access the couple's sprawling Santa Fe property. ""Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around February 18. Based on the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that Miss Hackman passed away first, with February 11 being the last time that she was going to be alive,"" said Jarrell. First responders found the door unlocked and open, and pills scattered next to Betsy Hackman's body, which was in the bathroom. Gene Hackman's body was found in another room, fully clothed, with sunglasses nearby, indicating a sudden fall. Investigators suggested it could be the case that the elder Hackman had not realized his wife was dead in the bathroom, given his advanced age and neurodegenerative disease. ""He was in an advanced state of Alzheimer's, and it's quite possible that he was not aware that she was deceased,"" the medical examiner said. A Hackman family spokesperson had previously denied reports of his Alzheimer's disease. In addition to the deceased couple, a dog was found dead in the bathroom, and two other healthy dogs were at the house. Along with the autopsies, the investigation had focussed on piecing together a timeline of the couple's last days, which detectives said had been complicated by their low profile and their preference for privacy. Hackman, a two-time Academy Award winner,Â was credited for intense performances inspired by his troubled upbringing, notching up dozens of movie credits extending into his 70s. He is perhaps best known as vulgar New York cop Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle in the 1971 crime thriller ""The French Connection"" -- for which he won an Oscar for best actor. He won another golden statuette two decades later for best supporting actor for his portrayal of the brutal small-town sheriff ""Little Bill"" Daggett in the 1992 western ""Unforgiven.""",showtime

He has taken the initiative to move to Bengaluru for a more âfulfilling and creativeâ experience. During an interview with the Hindu he said, âI want to stay away from film people.

I'm like, 'You don't want to make this movie? Don't make this movie.' But I just cannot. Because right from the beginning, before the film starts, it becomes about 'how do we sell it?'

Directed by Scott Derrickson, the film presents an ambitious premise that promises much more than it ultimately delivers. The plot centers on a mysterious gorge, hidden from the world and surrounded by thick mist. Since the 1940s, Cold War enemies have stationed elite operatives at nearby towers to guard the chasmâs deadly secret. The story follows two snipers, Levi (Miles Teller) and Drasa (Anya Taylor-Joy), tasked with monitoring the gorge. What begins as a professional mission slowly evolves into a tense and unconventional romance. Written by Zach Dean, known for his work on Fast X and The Tomorrow War, The Gorge offers an eerie setup with lots of potential. The tension between the two lead characters and the perilous environment creates a backdrop for a compelling narrative. Teller and Taylor-Joy deliver strong performances, particularly Taylor-Joy, whose portrayal adds warmth to an otherwise cold, tense world. However, despite these strong performances, the film struggles to balance its emotional stakes with its action-driven plot. The film swings between intimate character moments and intense action sequences, which, while visually impressive, often disrupt the emotional core of the story. The romance between Levi and Drasa is engaging. Still, it frequently takes a backseat to the over-the-top action, which, although visually captivating, can feel jarring against the filmâs more introspective moments. This tonal inconsistency makes it difficult to invest totally in the characters' journey as the rhythm floats between high-energy pieces and slower and more intimate scenes. Dan Laustsen's cinematography is a highlight, capturing the vast isolation of the canyon and the tension between the two protagonists. The action sequences are elegant and choreographed, while the scary score of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross adds an atmospheric touch to the dark moments of the movie. Despite its strong visual identity and exciting sequences, the gorge hesitates in its thematic exploitation. The film suggests deeper questions about human duty, survival, and connection, but does not plunge into these concepts. Although not the deepest movie of the year, the gorge remains a fun walk with solid performances. Its mixture of impressive genres and visuals makes it worth watching but lets you want him to explore his themes and characters deeper. The story may have been more suitable for a six-episode series, allowing suspense and chemistry to truly build.",showtime

Meghan Markle's new lifestyle show went live on Netflix Tuesday, showcasing the former British royal as a thriving domestic maven. Â  The Duchess of Sussex, wife to Britain's Prince Harry, harvests honey, makes pasta and mixes bath salts against an idyllic California backdrop. Â  A rustic and effortlessly chic home provides the setting for the first episode, whose conceit is that she is hosting a long-time friend. Â  Of course, we're not actually at Markle's house, but rather another luxury property near her home, where camera operators roam, offering purposely wobbly close-ups of candles, crudite and cake. Â  It also seems to have two kitchens. You know, like everyone's house does. Â  Harry -- whom Markle wed in a fairytale ceremony in 2018, and with whom she fled to California two years later -- only makes a fleeting appearance at the end of the eight episodes. Â  But there are little hints about life as a British royal; reminders of how -- in their telling -- the couple were spurned by a stuffy and racist establishment. Â  A friend who comes to stay, makeup artist Daniel Martin, ""has just been in my life from the before, during and after, shall we say,"" Markle tells an off-screen producer, with a meaningful pause to let viewers piece everything together. Â  Episodes of ""With Love, Meghan"" feature appearances from chef Alice Waters, actress Mindy Kaling and Abigail Spencer, one of Markle's ""Suits"" co-stars. Â  The show coincides with a rebranding of Markle's jam-and-cookies online retailer, which was originally called ""American Riviera Orchard"" but is now known as ""As Ever."" Â  The series is the latest effort by the Sussexes to make their own financial way after being cut off from the royal purse. Â  A reported $100 million deal with Netflix yielded the much-talked-about ""Harry & Meghan,"" a six-episode tell-all about their relationship and their high-profile split from the House of Windsor. Â  That was followed by Harry's successful autobiography ""Spare,"" which re-trod much of the same angry ground, with bonus tales about taking drugs in proximity to Hollywood celebs. Â  But subsequent media ventures that have not rehashed the same grievances have fallen flat. Â  A Spotify interview podcast by Markle was not renewed after a first series critics blasted as pointless, while Netflix offerings about the sport of polo and the Invictus Games failed to make much impression. Â  Early reviews of ""With Love, Meghan"" in the British press were not kind, with The Telegraph calling the series an ""exercise in narcissism."" Â  ""Meghan invites people to her pretend house"" wrote the paper's critic, and ""they tell her how amazing she is. This happens for eight episodes,"" it said. Â  Meanwhile Britain's The Times newspaper said the show was desperate in its ""upbeatness"" with Markle ""presenting her extreme wealth and mind-bogglingly exclusive lifestyle as if it is available to anyone.""",showtime

Prominent Indian singer-songwriter, politician, and cultural personality Kabir Suman has withdrawn his decision to donate his body after death, a commitment he made nearly four years ago. Â  In a Facebook post on Wednesday, the renowned musician wrote, âRamadan Mubarak. I want to inform everyone that some time ago, I announced on Facebook that I had donated my body and did not wish for any religious funeral rites. After much thought, I have changed my decision. I am withdrawing my wish to donate my body.â Â  He added, âI want to be buried in Kolkata, preferably in Gobra, following Islamic traditions. This is my final decision, and I have informed some of my close relatives.â Â  Suman also made it clear that he does not want any criticism or opinions regarding his decision. âI do not want any comments or opinions on this announcement,â he wrote. Â  The singer, born in a Hindu Brahmin family in Indiaâs Odisha on March 16, 1949, as Suman Chattopadhyay, gained immense popularity in the 1990s for introducing a unique musical style blending poetry with melody. Â  In 2000, he converted to Islam and adopted the name Kabir Suman, clarifying that he took the name Kabir after Sheikh Kabir, a Bengali Muslim poet who wrote âBaishnab Padabali.â Â  His groundbreaking album âTomake Chai,â released in April 1992, revolutionised Bengali music. Since then, the singer has remained a celebrated figure in both Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. Â  Beyond music, he was also involved in politics, supporting Mamata Banerjee during the Nandigram and Singur movements. He later became a Member of Parliament from Jadavpur under the Trinamool Congress but eventually parted ways with the party due to ideological differences. Â  Kabir Suman has maintained a deep connection with Bangladesh, which began with his first visit to Dhaka in 1996 to perform at a fundraising concert for the Liberation War Museum. Since 2000, he has been married to the iconic Bangladeshi singer Sabina Yasmin. Â  More recently, Dhaka hosted a special event titled âTomake Chai-er 30 Bochor Udjaponâ to celebrate 30 years of his iconic album âTomake Chaiâ.",showtime

Jazz Multimedia is bringing the horror movie 'Jinn 3' which claims to be based on a âtrue storyâ. 'Jinn 3' is directed by Kamruzzaman Roman. The shooting of the movie has already been completed. Currently, post-production is underway. The poster was released on Jazz Multimedia's verified page on Monday evening. The poster shows a child trapped in a white sack, whose eyes are white and glowing. There is a faint glow of fire amidst smoke and darkness around. The poster mentions that Nusraat Faria, Shajal, and many others have acted in it. Afran Nisho achieved success by debuting on the big screen with the movie 'Suranga' on Eid 2023. Since then, Nisho has been missing from movies for almost two years. This time, he is returning with his second movie 'Dagi' directed by Shihab Shaheen on Eid. In this movie too, Tama Mirza is acting opposite him, and Sunerah Binte Kamal is also there. Although the shooting ended a few days ago, no look or song, teaser of the movie has been released.

""While my detailed writings may embarrass him, the situation has forced me to speak the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be,"" he wrote. Farooki also expressed his admiration for Dr Jamilâs work, saying that he had written one of the most detailed articles about him in the Jaijaidin entertainment magazine âMouchake Dhilâ and had continued to write about him in both Bangla and English newspapers. He emphasized that he still considers Dr Jamil one of the most talented directors in Bangladesh's theater scene. âJust a few days ago, I even requested a foreign ambassador to collaborate with him on a theater production in their country,â he added. However, Farooki pointed out the distinct difference between being a good artist and managing an institution within the bureaucracy and highlighted that while running an organization requires patience and managerial skills, it is crucial to work with colleagues through love and respect rather than intimidation. âThe temperament required for leading a government institution is not the same as directing a theater troupe,â he said. Farooki mentioned that he had initially refrained from commenting out of respect. However, he noted that the need to set the record straight had compelled him to speak out. Farooki expressed his best wishes for Dr Jamilâs future and his creative endeavors. ""If I can be of any help in his future creative work, the ministry will be honored. I will also be happy to assist him after stepping down from my duties, although our fields of work differ,"" he added. The Shilpakala DG announced his resignation on Friday while speaking as the chief guest at the closing ceremony of the first Munier Choudhury National Theatre Festival at BSA's National Theatre Hall, citing administrative interference and bureaucratic obstacles as key reasons behind his decision. He claimed that he was unable to work independently and faced frequent delays in securing necessary allocations for the academyâs development. He further alleged that lack of cooperation from the government officials and employees, and issues related to corruption and syndicates made it difficult for him to fulfill his responsibilities.

https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/375027/remembering-haider-rizvi,Remembering Haider Rizvi,"28 Feb 2025, 05:45 PM","It was common knowledge that he had worked with some of the greatest Polish and Hollywood directors, but he hadnât made a film in Bangladesh yet for fund and infrastructure issues Some deaths hit you like a bolt from the blue, even if the storm had been gathering for some time. Haider Rizvi was 80 years old, still working in full capacity, gearing up to direct his first feature length film. It never occurred to us that he may not live to finish the film for which he had won the national film grant. He wasnât ill as far as we knew. But on February 9, 2025, Haider Rizvi passed away after being admitted to the hospital for acute stomach ache. His death resembled his life in a way. The film fraternity, especially his students, mourned him from the depths of their hearts. But the newspapers didnât seem to have taken notice of his passing. Itâs not as if independent filmmakers donât make it to the obituary section. They do. Take for example a director who died two weeks after Haider Rizvi at the age of 60. His death was all over the news, including some Indian papers. His body was placed in front of the National Museum for the general public to pay their last respects, which wasnât something that happened in the case of Rizvi sir. From the outside, it looked as though the mourning of his death was upstaged by someone younger and more accomplished according to the current standards of success. I address him as sir for I was his student back in 2012-2013. He was all of our favourite teacher by far, the only one who understood and appreciated the point of view of our generation. It was common knowledge that he had worked with some of the greatest Polish and Hollywood directors, but he hadnât made a film in Bangladesh yet for fund and infrastructure issues. When I decided to study Screenwriting at UCLA, he had warned me that it might be hard to come back to Bangladesh once Iâve had a taste of working with big names. He confessed, with some regret, it kept him from coming back in his younger days. He was among the first few who asked me to teach screenwriting classes, as a part of the courses he taught at some film institutes in 2017. I later realized how generous it was of him to ask me to take those classes. Teachers in these institutes are paid on a per class basis and most not only refuse to give others any class, they fight over getting more classes themselves; whether theyâre experts in the subject or not is often an overlooked detail. Itâs sort of like the competition of securing more hours among the hourly paid minimum wage earners. But Rizvi sir didnât play those lowly games; no wonder it took him so long to secure that fund to make his film. In class, he used to wear blue jeans with full sleeve shirts, tucked in; always addressed us as âBhaiaâ or âBetaâ. Unlike most of his peers, who abhorred popular films and looked down on the local audience, Rizvi sir vehemently championed films that âmade senseâ and communicated well. He talked very little in class as karma yogis tend to do, but the lionâs share of what he said was gold for us. To this day, I quote him in my classes and remember his teachings when I write scripts. In 2022, one of his students, Razib Ahsan, compiled a book, âHaider Rizvi: Cinemaloker Porompurush,â a treasure trove of write-ups by people close to him. The article by his brother, Gowher Rizvi, was particularly heart-warming. In his article, reading about how Rizvi sir fearlessly participated in the 1971 war, how he used his wit to escape certain death at the hands of Pakistani soldiers, and after independence, how he fought for our television industry only to see it take a nose dive into mediocrity- gives us a picture of his gigantic stature as a person and as a professional. Now from beyond the grave, Rizvi sir keeps inspiring us with the work and the words he left behind. Maybe the world doesnât regard every noteworthy human being with the honour they deserve. Maybe the media doesnât celebrate the silent heroes behind the camera. But that ceases to matter when you know how much you were loved and respected. Iâm glad Rizvi sir got to read that book written on him. Iâm glad, in the end, no Roman Polanski or Lars von Trier could hold him back from returning to Bangladesh. Many would instantly line up to be their assistant directors, but for us, Rizvi sir was irreplaceable.",showtime

https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/374345/the-art-of-living-finding-beauty-in-simplicity,Art of living: Finding beauty in simplicity with 'Perfect Days',"21 Feb 2025, 02:49 PM","At the heart of Perfect Days is Hirayama, played masterfully by KÅji Yakusho, a middle-aged man who cleans Tokyoâs public restrooms with a sense of devotion rarely seen in modern narratives Wim Wendersâ Perfect Days is more than just a filmâit is an ode to the quiet dignity of a simple life, a meditation on the fulfilment that can be found in daily routines, and a love letter to Tokyoâs hidden corners. Through the eyes of Hirayama, a man who finds joy in the smallest of moments, the film invites us to reconsider what it truly means to be happy. At the heart of Perfect Days is Hirayama, played masterfully by KÅji Yakusho, a middle-aged man who cleans Tokyoâs public restrooms with a sense of devotion rarely seen in modern narratives. His life follows a strict rhythm: waking up in his modest apartment, carefully folding his futon, tending to his plants, and immersing himself in the music of the past through his beloved cassette tapes. His job, often considered menial by society, is performed with meticulous care, transforming public restrooms into pristine, almost sacred spaces. Through Wendersâ lens, these daily rituals become acts of quiet reverence, a reminder that purpose is not dictated by social status but by the dedication we bring to our actions. Hirayamaâs job is not a burden but a craftâone that allows him to experience life with clarity and appreciation. One of the most striking elements of Perfect Days is its ability to turn the mundane into the extraordinary. Whether itâs the sunlight filtering through tree branches, the act of enjoying a canned coffee by the river, or the small interactions with strangers, every moment is presented with a sense of deep, unspoken beauty. Hirayamaâs contentment stands in stark contrast to the modern worldâs obsession with ambition and material success. He has no desire for excess, no need for digital distractions. Instead, he lives fully in each passing moment, savouring the sounds of the city, the touch of the wind, and the rhythms of life. While many films portray Tokyo as a neon-lit metropolis brimming with chaos, Wenders takes us on a journey through its quieter, more intimate spaces. The public restrooms Hirayama cleans are not just facilities they are architectural masterpieces designed by renowned artists, blending functionality with artistry. Each location is captured with a painterly eye, showcasing Tokyo as a city where beauty exists in unexpected places. Wendersâ slow, deliberate cinematography allows the audience to absorb the textures, colours, and rhythms of a life often overlooked. KÅji Yakushoâs performance is one of restraint and quiet depth. Through subtle expressions and body language, he conveys a lifetime of emotionsâsatisfaction, nostalgia, loneliness, and peace. The absence of excessive dialogue makes every glance and movement more profound, allowing the audience to interpret the depths of Hirayamaâs inner world on their own terms. His portrayal earned him the Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival, a testament to the power of his understated brilliance. A meditation on modern life Perfect Days is more than just a character studyâit is an invitation to reflect on our own lives. In an era where people are constantly chasing the next big achievement, the film asks: What if happiness isnât about having more, but about appreciating what we already have? Hirayamaâs life may seem simple, but it is rich with meaning. His love for music, nature, and human connection reminds us that joy is not found in grand gestures, but in the small, everyday moments we often take for granted. Perfect Days is not a film that shoutsâit whispers. It doesnât demand attention; instead, it rewards patience. It is a cinematic experience that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, urging us to slow down, breathe, and find beauty in the world around us. In a time when life feels increasingly fast-paced and complicated, Perfect Days serves as a gentle yet powerful reminder: happiness is not about what we do, but how we choose to experience it.",showtime
